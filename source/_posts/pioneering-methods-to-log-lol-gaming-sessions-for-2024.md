## Way 2\. Use OBS Studio to Record LOL

If you are a part of any gaming community, you must have heard gamers using OBS Studio to live stream their gameplay on YouTube, Twitch and other platforms. Well, OBS Studio is equally useful in recording your gameplay. In fact, the software is available free of cost and there is no dearth of advanced settings to better gameplay recording. The user interface is not as easy as other gameplay recorders but here is how to record LOL games with OBS Studio.

Step 1: Download and install OBS Studio for free.

Step 2: Open OBS Studio and click on “+” icon from Sources tab. From the menu, select Game Capture option.

## Way 3\. Record LOL Games with Windows Game Bar

If you are a Windows 10 user and you want to record your game for the first time, you can opt for Windows Game Bar app. The application comes pre-installed on Windows 10\. Therefore, there is no need for any external gameplay recorder. However, there are reports from gamers that when you record your LOL games through Windows Game Bar, the game performance can lag at times. If that is not the case with you, you can use Windows Game Bar to capture screenshots and record gameplay in simple steps.

![windows game bar recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/launch-xbox-game-bar.jpg)

Step 2: Open LOL game on your computer and start playing the game. Press Windows + Alt + R keys together to start recording LOL gameplay.

Step 3: You can stop recording anytime by pressing Windows + Alt + R together again.

You can find the recorded video by going to Widgets and then to Gallery section.
