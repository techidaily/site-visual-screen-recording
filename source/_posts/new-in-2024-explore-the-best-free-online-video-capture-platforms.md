### 10\. Screenr

Screenr is remarkable because it excels in the annotation. Annotating is a hard thing to get right without confusing the user. Screenr manages to do it well, without all of the getting lost, undoing your notes, and having to add them again offline. It also allows seamless file sharing, which is excellent if you are a lecturer or a project manager.

**Pros**:

* This is a high-performing platform that is programmed for speed.
* One-click capture and share of annotations.
* A significant focus on document annotations that make it clean-cut and professional.

### 11. [Bewisse](https://record.bewisse.com/)

Lewis is a smart-but-friendly looking free online screen recorder service that is entirely free. Unfortunately, it isn’t compatible with the Microsoft Edge internet browser, which is weird. Programmed to run with Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, Bewisse perhaps works best with Apple or Mac OS’s. However, they have a great free screenshot capture feature that doesn’t need a login.

**Pros**:

* You don’t need to set up an account with them, log in, or give away any details.
* There is no installation required to use it.
* It is entirely free to use.

**Cons**:

* It’s a little on the primary side.
* It only works if you have a Firefox or Chrome browser.
