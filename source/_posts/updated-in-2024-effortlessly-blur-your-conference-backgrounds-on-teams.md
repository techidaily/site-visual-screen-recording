## FAQs about Blur Teams Meeting Background

**Q1) Why canâ€™t I blur my background in Microsoft Teams?**

**A1)** If youâ€™re unable to see the â€˜Blurâ€™ tile or the â€˜Background settingsâ€™ option altogether, probably your PC doesnâ€™t have Advanced Vector Extension 2 (AVX2) graphics. While Microsoft is still working to make the â€˜Blurâ€™ option enable for all the devices, no official statement from the organization has been released to date.

On the other hand, if your computer has AVX2 and you still cannot see the option, you can try a couple of things, and see if any of those works for you. For instance, you can:

* Sign out of Teams and then sign back in
* Check for and update the webcam driver
* Check for and install the most updated version of Microsoft Teams
* Restart your computer

**Q2) Can I blur the background in the Teams Business version?**

**A2)** Yes, you can. Microsoft Teams (Free), Microsoft 365 Business Basic, and Microsoft 365 Business Standard versions allow you to blur the background with ease. You can find more details on the features and compatible programs on the (<https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/microsoft-teams/compare-microsoft-teams-options>) link.

## FAQs about Blur Teams Meeting Background

**Q1) Why canâ€™t I blur my background in Microsoft Teams?**

**A1)** If youâ€™re unable to see the â€˜Blurâ€™ tile or the â€˜Background settingsâ€™ option altogether, probably your PC doesnâ€™t have Advanced Vector Extension 2 (AVX2) graphics. While Microsoft is still working to make the â€˜Blurâ€™ option enable for all the devices, no official statement from the organization has been released to date.

On the other hand, if your computer has AVX2 and you still cannot see the option, you can try a couple of things, and see if any of those works for you. For instance, you can:

* Sign out of Teams and then sign back in
* Check for and update the webcam driver
* Check for and install the most updated version of Microsoft Teams
* Restart your computer

**Q2) Can I blur the background in the Teams Business version?**

**A2)** Yes, you can. Microsoft Teams (Free), Microsoft 365 Business Basic, and Microsoft 365 Business Standard versions allow you to blur the background with ease. You can find more details on the features and compatible programs on the (<https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/microsoft-teams/compare-microsoft-teams-options>) link.

If you have a meeting scheduled at a particular time but donâ€™t know what to do with that homely background that wouldnâ€™t go with the professional ambiance, luckily Microsoft Teams lets you blur it quite conveniently. The process is described as follows:

**Step 1: Initiate a New Meeting Session**

Launch Microsoft Teams, and make sure that the **Chat** icon is selected in the left pane. From the top of the **Chat** pane, click the **New Meeting** (**Camcorder**) icon, and click **Start meeting**.

## FAQs about Blur Teams Meeting Background

**Q1) Why canâ€™t I blur my background in Microsoft Teams?**

**A1)** If youâ€™re unable to see the â€˜Blurâ€™ tile or the â€˜Background settingsâ€™ option altogether, probably your PC doesnâ€™t have Advanced Vector Extension 2 (AVX2) graphics. While Microsoft is still working to make the â€˜Blurâ€™ option enable for all the devices, no official statement from the organization has been released to date.

On the other hand, if your computer has AVX2 and you still cannot see the option, you can try a couple of things, and see if any of those works for you. For instance, you can:

* Sign out of Teams and then sign back in
* Check for and update the webcam driver
* Check for and install the most updated version of Microsoft Teams
* Restart your computer

**Q2) Can I blur the background in the Teams Business version?**

**A2)** Yes, you can. Microsoft Teams (Free), Microsoft 365 Business Basic, and Microsoft 365 Business Standard versions allow you to blur the background with ease. You can find more details on the features and compatible programs on the (<https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/microsoft-teams/compare-microsoft-teams-options>) link.
