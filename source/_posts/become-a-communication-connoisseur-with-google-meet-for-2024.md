Many individuals wonder if they can privately chat on Google Meet, however that option is not possible in the Google Meet chat feature till now.

For instance, if a participant leaves a meeting and you send a message when they have left, then that participant joins again, the participant will not be able to receive or view your message. However, all those present in the session while the message was sent can read it. There is no option to create a private chat on Google Meet as of now.
