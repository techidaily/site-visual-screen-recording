## Your Guide to the Top 5 Chromebook Sniping Software

Using a snipping tool is simple and can be done on a computer, a laptop, or any device capable of using it. It's similar to taking a screenshot on a computer when the Print Screen option is available. You can crop out the unwanted parts by snipping out the part of the image you want from the screen.

When taking screenshots, a Chromebook may be a little different from a Windows or Mac computer. Whether you use the native method or a third-party tool, the process is the same.

It's easy to grab any area of the screen using the keyboard commands, whether it's the entire screen or just a portion. Nonetheless, if this method does not meet your needs, you can find a suitable third-party alternative. This article will show you how you can take screenshots using the keyboard shortcuts on a Chromebook. Furthermore, we will also discuss some of the best Chromebook snipping tools that you can use to get the job done.

## **Best Snipping Tools Chromebook**

Using keyboard shortcuts is the easiest way to take a screenshot of your Chromebook screen.

By pressing CTRL+Window Switch (Show Windows), you can capture your Chromebook's entire screen. Holding CTRL+Shift and pressing the Window Switch (Show Windows) key, select the area you want to capture, then drag the crosshair icon from the trackpad.

Use the stylus with your Chromebook to take full or partial screenshots and annotate, or use the Power+Volume Down buttons to snap a quick screenshot. Even though Chromebook's snipping tool is a bit lacking, there are a number of Chrome extensions and apps that can improve it. Check out the list below.

### 1.LightShot

![lightshot-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lightshot-poster.png)

Chromebook users can use LightShot for free, and Windows and Mac users can use it too. With it, you can take, edit, and upload screenshots to the server as a Chrome extension or as a program. Simply drag and drop a screenshot over any part of your Chromebook's screen, edit it in place, then download it or send it to Google Drive with this handy tool.

When you want to take a screenshot with LightShot, you press the extension or the app to bring up the segment where you can do it. The screenshot you took can also be copied to the clipboard by selecting any part of the page you want to capture. With this app, you can instantly edit your screen captures after capturing them or later using a powerful online editor.

### 2.Nimbus Capture

![nimbus-capture-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/nimbus-capture-poster.png)

You can use Nimbus Capture on a computer system, through a browser, or even with mobile devices. It is free, although some optional features are available for a fee. On the other hand, the tool itself is sufficient, as it enables you to save screenshots, edit them on the fly, blur certain parts, and upload them or share them right away online.

With Nimbus Capture, you can take screenshots of your Chromebook's entire screen or just part of it. With the tool, you can draw on screenshots or record videos using your webcam of any tab or the whole desktop.

By creating recordings so you can communicate easily, the tool captures partial or complete web pages, helping you save time on writing tutorials. With one click, you can choose one of the many screenshot options, such as showing only the visible area of the page, taking a screenshot of just the selected area, or taking a screenshot of the whole screen. As well as offering powerful editing tools, the annotation panel enhances your writing and content to make it clearer, more illuminating, and more effective.
