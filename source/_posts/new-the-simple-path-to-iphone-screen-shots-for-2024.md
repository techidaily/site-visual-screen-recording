## Part 1\. How Do You Screen Record on iPhone?

iOS devices have different features, functionality, and entirely different working. Unlike Android devices, iOS deals with things differently. Due to this reason, there is a slight difference in screen recording when it comes to iPhone. Not every iPhone user knows how to enable screen recording on iPhone but don't worry; we got you. Let's share the steps for enabling your iPhone's settings.

Step 1: To enable screen recording in your iPhone, firstly head over to the 'Settings' app and then look for 'Control Center.' Tap on the 'Customize Controls' option from the Control Center screen.
