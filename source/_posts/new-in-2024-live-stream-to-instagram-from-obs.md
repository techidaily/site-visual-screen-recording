On Streamon, you will see a Speech Bubble icon where you can check the live chat messages and manage them accordingly. In order to check if your live stream is going correctly, you can open your web browser and go to “www.instagram.com/USERNAME/live” where you have to replace USERNAME with your Instagram username.
