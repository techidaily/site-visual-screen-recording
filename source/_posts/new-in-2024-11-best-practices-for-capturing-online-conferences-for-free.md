## Part 4\. Record Webinar on Android Phones

Unlike iPhone, most Android phones do not have a built-in screen recorder. That is why you have to install an external screen recorder app to record webinar for free.

The app does not save the recorded video on their servers but only on the user's device. There is no signing up required as you can record your screen instantly.
