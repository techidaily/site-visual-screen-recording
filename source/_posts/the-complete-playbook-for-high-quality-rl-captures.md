## The Bottom Line

League of Legends is a high-end game and you cannot let recording in the background to affect the performance and face lag issues. That is why you have to choose a gameplay recorder wisely if you want to record LOL games. We have picked the top five best gameplay recorders, some of which are premium while others are free. We recommend Wondershare Filmora as you can record at 4K resolution and edit your video to make it more interesting and eye-catching.
