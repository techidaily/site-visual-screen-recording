## Way 5\. Use Screencastify

Screencastify is a Google Chrome extension and many users prefer it over an online tool. Even though it is free to use but the free version is limited to 5 minutes only. The premium version allows you to record any screen activity without any restriction. You can not only record live stream meeting as a viewer but also as a speaker. This is because you can record from webcam and external mic. There are also drawing tools available. Here are the steps to record from any live stream conference software and online platforms.

Step 1: Visit “www.screencastify.com/products/screen-recorder” and click on Add to Chrome button.
