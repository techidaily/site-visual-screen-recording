Filters and effects are an exciting and useful feature offered by Google Meet to its users. However, Google Meet does not allow all accounts to use filters and mask in the same way. To cut the story short, some of the masks and filters might be accessible with workspace, while others are only usable through your personal Gmail accounts.

If you want to know the requirements for using filters and effects on specific devices and different accounts, the following section will discuss them in detail.
