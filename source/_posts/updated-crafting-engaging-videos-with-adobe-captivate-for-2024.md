#### Step 1 - Setting up a video recording session

Double-click on Adobe Captivate's desktop icon to launch the software, and then head over to Microsft PowerPoint and open the presentation you'd like to record in the second monitor.

Click on the Demo option in the Adobe Captivate's welcome window, and then click on the Create button in the lower right corner of the screen.

#### Step 2 - Select the application and designate the area of the screen you'd like to record

After you click on the Create button, a new window will appear on the screen. In the upper left corner of the window, you'll be able to see Screen Area and Application options.
