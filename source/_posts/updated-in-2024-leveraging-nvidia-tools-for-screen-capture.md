## Part 3\. Performance and Requirements

There have been concerns raised by professional gamers that when you use NVIDIA ShadowPlay to record gameplay or even broadcast gameplay live, it affects the performance of the game.

This means no matter which screen recorder you use, there will always be some dip in the performance of the game, and you should learn to neglect it.
