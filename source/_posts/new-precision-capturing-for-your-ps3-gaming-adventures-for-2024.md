Since PS3 does not have any means to record gameplay into the gaming console, you have to connect your gaming console to computer for recording. However, you cannot connect a gaming console directly to your computer for playing games and recording them. You need to buy a capture card to connect your gaming console to computer. The most popular capture card is Elgato Game Capture HD. You can record PS3 gameplay at a very high quality and here are the steps to follow.
