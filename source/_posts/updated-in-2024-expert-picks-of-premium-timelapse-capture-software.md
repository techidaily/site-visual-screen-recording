### 2\. Does time-lapse record sound?

Experts say that while shooting a time-lapse video, the device can't record the audio, and hence the audio doesn't get recorded; moreover, the effect is visible after the recording is completed.

You must use a third-party application to adjust the video's sound effects. Some of the latest applications also offer the audio feature, and you can browse the internet to learn more about them.

### 3\. Can you screen record a timelapse iPad?
