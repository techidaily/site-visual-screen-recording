This past year, many of us have been forced to go through long, fastidious video meetings via platforms such as [Zoom](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Skype, or Google Meet. Though it has proven to be an efficient and useful way of connecting with a team or with loved ones, maybe you’re sick and tired of enduring long hours of tasteless video calls and want to spice things up. One of the ways to do so is to use Snap Camera with Google Meet, in order to have access to the multitude of filters available on Snapchat. Let’s talk about how to do so.

_If you’re using the Zoom app to have a video conference, you can also use Snap Camera on it. Check this article to find [how to use Snap Camera on Zoom meetings](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)._

## Part 1: How to Download and Set up Snap Camera with Google Meet?

The first thing you’ll need to do is download and install the Snap Camera. It’s a very easy process. Visit the [Snap Camera website](https://snapcamera.snapchat.com/) and click the Download button to start. Please note you’ll need a Windows 10 (64 bit) or newer; or a macOS 10.13 or newer to be able to download and install the Snap Camera.

Once downloaded, find the file on your desktop and double click to install. On the mac, you’ll need to drag the icon to the applications file (when you click the downloaded file it usually automatically shows you what to do).

Open the snap camera and you’ll be able to see your face on the screen. That’s it, you’ve downloaded the Snap Camera. Select the preferred filters and lens from the below list and check the result in the video stream window. Now onto the next step, which is configuring the Snap Camera to work with Google Meet.

## Part 2: How to Use Snap Camera on Google Meet?

There are two different ways of using the snap camera on Google Meet - the first method is to log in via Gmail and the second is to access Google Meet directly from the website.

**Method 1: Gmail login**

**Step 1:** Log in to your Gmail account and on the left-hand side of your Gmail landing page, you will see two options under Meet: New meeting and Join a meeting.

So, to create a new meeting, click on “New meeting”, and then select Start an instant meeting to create. You can also create a meeting for later or schedule a meeting in Google Calendar. If you don’t see these two options, log in first, and then you’ll be able to access the two buttons.

## Part 4: How to Add Filters to Google Meet Without Snap Camera on Mobile

**Step 1:** Open Google Meet on your [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.meetings&hl=fr&gl=US) device or [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/google-meet/id1013231476).

**Step 2:** Follow the usual steps: start a meeting or join an existing one.

**Step 3:** As soon as you access your meeting, tap on the “Effects” icon situated near the bottom of your face on the screen.

**Step 4:** You’ll be able to access different options under the Effects icon, such as Blur, Backgrounds, Style. At the very end, you’ll find “Filters”.

## Part 5: Google Meet Adds Video Filters and AR Stickers for Personal Call

Google Meet recently added new filters, effects, and AR (augmented reality) masks for calls on iOS and Android. On July 7th, Google tweeted that the new features would be available: “cats, astronauts, jellyfish and more”... Sounds exciting! Here’s how to add them to your Google Meet calls.

![ Google Meet AR Stickers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-new-ar-stickers-news-on-twitter.jpg)

**Step 1:** If you haven’t yet, download Google Meet for Android or iOS and then open it.

**Step 2:** Select a meeting to enter - you can either open a new one or join an existing one.

This past year, many of us have been forced to go through long, fastidious video meetings via platforms such as [Zoom](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Skype, or Google Meet. Though it has proven to be an efficient and useful way of connecting with a team or with loved ones, maybe you’re sick and tired of enduring long hours of tasteless video calls and want to spice things up. One of the ways to do so is to use Snap Camera with Google Meet, in order to have access to the multitude of filters available on Snapchat. Let’s talk about how to do so.

_If you’re using the Zoom app to have a video conference, you can also use Snap Camera on it. Check this article to find [how to use Snap Camera on Zoom meetings](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)._

## Part 1: How to Download and Set up Snap Camera with Google Meet?

The first thing you’ll need to do is download and install the Snap Camera. It’s a very easy process. Visit the [Snap Camera website](https://snapcamera.snapchat.com/) and click the Download button to start. Please note you’ll need a Windows 10 (64 bit) or newer; or a macOS 10.13 or newer to be able to download and install the Snap Camera.

Once downloaded, find the file on your desktop and double click to install. On the mac, you’ll need to drag the icon to the applications file (when you click the downloaded file it usually automatically shows you what to do).

Open the snap camera and you’ll be able to see your face on the screen. That’s it, you’ve downloaded the Snap Camera. Select the preferred filters and lens from the below list and check the result in the video stream window. Now onto the next step, which is configuring the Snap Camera to work with Google Meet.
