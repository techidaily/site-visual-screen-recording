Screencasting on any version of Windows 7/8/10 is a simple task, and countless software products enable you to record your desktop activities.

Most screen recorders create MP4 or MOV files that can get quite large, making them hard to send or easily distribute over the Internet.

On the other hand, GIFs are small in size, and sending them via email or posting them on social media networks won't require you to wait for a long time until the file is uploaded to the web.

However, there aren't that many screen recorders for Windows OS that let you save screen recordings as GIF files, and for that reason, we've composed the list of best **GIF Recorders** for PCs. Let's have a look at some of the most powerful software products for creating animated GIFs on Windows.

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility** **:** Windows 7 or later

Most screen recorders create MP4 or MOV files that can get quite large, making them hard to send or easily distribute over the Internet.

However, there aren't that many screen recorders for Windows OS that let you save screen recordings as GIF files, and for that reason, we've composed the list of best **GIF Recorders** for PCs. Let's have a look at some of the most powerful software products for creating animated GIFs on Windows.

Definitely yes. All you need is an excellent tool. Here are some free tools that can help you turn a video into a GIF. Convertio is an online tool allowing you convert your mp4 files to gif for free. UniConverter is also a versatile tool that can turn your videos into gifs and convert images to gifs for free.

#### 3\. What is the best GIF recorder on Mac?

Lots of apps can [record GIFs on Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). I will recommend three software – Giphy Capture, GIF Brewery, and Smart GIF Maker.
