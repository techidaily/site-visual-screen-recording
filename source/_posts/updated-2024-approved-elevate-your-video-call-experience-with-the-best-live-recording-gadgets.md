The recording option stays activated for seven days. Thereafter, you have to activate it again from General section.

Step 3: The recording will stop automatically as soon as you stop your live stream. If you want to stop recording in between, you have to disable the recording option and save VOD file. You can find the recorded video under “Video on Demand” option.

It is important to note that you can record Dacast live stream video only if you are the creator of the video. It is not possible for a viewer to record with Dacast and the viewer needs to use a dedicated screen recorder.

## Way 3\. Record with Restream

Restream is another popular live streaming platform and you can live stream your video on almost all the popular online live streaming websites. If you are using Restream to live stream video, you can record your video as well. First of all, Restream Studio automatically records your live stream videos as soon as you go live.
