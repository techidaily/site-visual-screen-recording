### 3\. Wire

The online platform Wire is one of the best video calling apps for pcs. It takes a different approach from our list's other video calling apps. Rather than focusing on call quality and signal strength, they focus more intensely on the security side of things. The wire is, in effect, the best video calling app for pcs with Windows 10 if you want to be sure nobody can trace or watch your calls.

Wire’s Main Features

Some of the features that make Wire such a fantastic video calling app for pc (Windows 10) are:

Zalo is the best video calling app for PC that will let you call while you stream or game.

Zalo’s Main Features

The one that everyone knows by name (and by far the most popular video calling app for PCs) is Skype.
