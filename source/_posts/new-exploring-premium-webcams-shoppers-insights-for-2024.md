Essentially, a webcam is a video camera, that works as an input device for computers. It captures either still pictures or motion videos of users, which can then be uploaded or streamed via the internet. Today, most laptops come with a built-in webcam, embedded into the display. Other webcams are small cameras that either attach to a monitor or sit on a desk and connect to a computer’s USB or FireWire port. Unlike a traditional digital camera, a webcam doesn’t have any built-in storage. Rather a webcam must always be connected to a computer, which it uses for storage.

In this buyer’s guide, we will introduce the 10 best webcams for your PC or Mac based on your budget and needs.

We love how easy this webcam has been made to use, and the low-price makes up for any shortcomings.

#### 8. [**Logitech 4K Pro**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=logitech+4k+pro+webcam&index=aps&tag=googhydr-21&ref=pd%5Fsl%5F5f2r62abgq%5Fe&adgrpid=59977001904&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=259121289280&hvpos=1t1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=14806622530510668825&hvqmt=e&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9046579&hvtargid=kwd-321913244574) \[**Best HD Webcam** \]

Essentially, a webcam is a video camera, that works as an input device for computers. It captures either still pictures or motion videos of users, which can then be uploaded or streamed via the internet. Today, most laptops come with a built-in webcam, embedded into the display. Other webcams are small cameras that either attach to a monitor or sit on a desk and connect to a computer’s USB or FireWire port. Unlike a traditional digital camera, a webcam doesn’t have any built-in storage. Rather a webcam must always be connected to a computer, which it uses for storage.

In this buyer’s guide, we will introduce the 10 best webcams for your PC or Mac based on your budget and needs.

Unfortunately, unlike the C920 the 4K Pro’s clip doesn’t hold tight to the display. However, if you can compromise with that, then the 4K Pro streams some of the highest quality videos you’ll find right now if you have the software to support 4K!

#### 9. [Mevo](https://www.amazon.com/Mevo-Camera-select-Android-devices/dp/B01G6BIN8C) \[**Best Webcam for Livestreaming on the Go** \]

**Pros:**

* 4K live streaming
* Compatible with mobile devices
* Extreme portability

**Cons:**

* Expensive pricing

This webcam was designed by the Livestream team and allows you to stream from anywhere to Livestream, Vimeo, Periscope, YouTube, Facebook Live and Twitter via Wi-Fi or LTE. The Mevo is small enough to fit in your pocket, yet it delivers a **premium streaming experience with 2160p 4K recording**. Mevo’s **Live Editing Suite** allows you to tap to cut, pinch to zoom or swipe to pan. Alternatively, you can enable autopilot and let **Mevo’s AI edit the videos for you**. For aspiring multimedia journalists, the Mevo is like having **a portable TV studio!**

#### 10. [Razer Kiyo](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kiyo-Streaming-Optimized-Built/dp/B075N1BYWB)\[**Best Webcam for Gaming and Streaming** \]

![ webcam ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/razer-kiyo-webcam.jpg)

**Pros:**

* Convenient ring-light
* 1080p HD streaming
* Designed for Twitch streamers

**Cons:**

* Expensive

The Kiyo is an innovative camera focussed on streaming. Razer is very popular with gamers and for this camera, Razer has stripped away all the unnecessary features that higher-end webcams claim and focus on good image quality and lighting with their special **Light Ring**. Their Light Ring is a new feature, with **twelve white LED lights surrounding the lens**. It can shoot **60 FPS at 720p and 30 FPS at Full HD 1080p.** The camera it also comes with **built-in support for Xsplit and OBS** making it ideal for gamers.

So, if you are looking for the best all-around webcam then the Logitech C920 is still the best on the market. It provides good performance at an excellent price. If you are looking for something a bit cheaper than the Microsoft LifeCam is the best webcam for PC and the Logitech C270 is the best for mac. For the professionals, the Creative Labs Senz3D is the most exclusive webcam, the Logitech 4K pro is the best HD webcam and the Mevo is the most portable.

Besides the best webcam, you may also need a recording software that allows you to [record the screen/gameplay and the webcam at the same time](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). In this case, we do recommend you to record with [Filmora Scrn](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Check the video below about [how to record screen and webcam video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with Filmora Scrn.
