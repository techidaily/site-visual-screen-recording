## Part 1: How To Create a Google Meet on Laptop?

There are three different ways through which an individual can create and schedule a Google Meet session through their laptop.

* A user can **create Google Meet** conferences through Gmail
* They can schedule in a session on Google Calendar
* An individual can directly create a meeting through the Google Meet website

### 1. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Gmail

Scheduling a session through Gmail is fairly simple, for this all the user requires is access to a Gmail account and they are good to go. First what one must do is sign into their Gmail account and go to the homepage.

On the left side of their screen, they will see options under the ‚ÄúMeet‚Äù heading, one is ‚ÄúNew Meeting‚Äù and the other is ‚ÄúJoin a Meeting‚Äù. If you are looking to create a new meeting then click on the ‚ÄúNew Meeting‚Äù option.

Once that option is clicked, the user will be redirected to a new page that contains a meeting link.

![ google meet invitation link on Gmail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gmail-google-meet-invitation-link.jpg)

Over here there are three options. By clicking the ‚Äúcopy link‚Äù button, individuals can copy and share the link with people they would like to invite to the meeting.

If they want to directly share the link, they can also click the ‚ÄúSend Invite‚Äù button and copy the meeting invite from there as well as share via email.

Upon clicking the ‚ÄúShare Via Email‚Äù option, users will be redirected to a new tab where they can see an email pop up and from there, they can invite participants to the session through their email address, as indicated in the image below.

If individuals want to instantly create and start the session, they can click the ‚ÄúStart Now‚Äù option, and the meeting will automatically start.

### 2. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Google Calendar

Another way to create a Google Meet session is through the Google Calendar. Much like the process of creating it through Gmail, there are a few steps involved, but the process is very easy.

First individuals must go to the Google Calendar homepage and click the ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù button.

![create google meet  on google calendar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-google-meet-session-google-calendar.jpg)

After clicking the create option, the screen will show two options; ‚Äú Event‚Äù and ‚ÄúTask‚Äù. Click the event option and a pop-up form will show up on the window which must be filled to create a Google Meet event.

Fill in the form, if you would like to invite participants to the Google Meet conference, you can also list down their email address in the ‚ÄúAdd Guests‚Äù section. Once you have done that click the ‚ÄúAdd Google Meet Video Conferencing‚Äù option.

![add google meet  on google calendar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-google-meet-video-conferencing-calendar.jpg)

An event link will appear in the form, along with a button that says ‚ÄúJoin With Google Meet‚Äù. Once you are done filling in the form, click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![join google meet  via  google calendar link](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/join-google-meet-via-google-calendar-link.jpg)

If you are looking to join the conference instantly, click the ‚ÄúJoin With Google Meet‚Äù option and you will be redirected to the conference. If you would like to join later, you can copy the joining link and search it on the Google search bar to be redirected to the conference.

### 3. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Google Meet

Did you know you can directly create a conference through the Google Meet homepage as well? All you have to do is go to the Google Meet homepage and click the ‚ÄúNew Meeting‚Äù button.

Upon clicking the button, you will see three options. From that click the ‚ÄúStart an Instant Meeting‚Äù option and you will be redirected to a new conference.

Upon clicking that button, three new options will appear:

### 1. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Gmail

Scheduling a session through Gmail is fairly simple, for this all the user requires is access to a Gmail account and they are good to go. First what one must do is sign into their Gmail account and go to the homepage.

On the left side of their screen, they will see options under the ‚ÄúMeet‚Äù heading, one is ‚ÄúNew Meeting‚Äù and the other is ‚ÄúJoin a Meeting‚Äù. If you are looking to create a new meeting then click on the ‚ÄúNew Meeting‚Äù option.

Once that option is clicked, the user will be redirected to a new page that contains a meeting link.

Over here there are three options. By clicking the ‚Äúcopy link‚Äù button, individuals can copy and share the link with people they would like to invite to the meeting.

If they want to directly share the link, they can also click the ‚ÄúSend Invite‚Äù button and copy the meeting invite from there as well as share via email.
