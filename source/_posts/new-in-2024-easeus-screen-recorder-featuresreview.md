## How to Use EaseUS RecExperts

When you complete the EaseUS RecExperts download, the program will install on your system as a standalone app. You won't need any additional add-ons. EaseUS RecExperts for mac should soon be out as the developer has envisaged a huge potential with the OS.

Step 1\. Launch EaseUS RecExperts. There are two different options for screen recording, i.e., "Full Screen" and "Region". If you select "Full Screen", you will capture the whole screen.

Step 2\. If you select the "Region" option, this software will ask you to customize the recording area. Make sure that everything you want to capture is within the bounds of the select box.

Step 3\. Tap on the button at the bottom left side of the main interface, and there will be many options you can select. This recorder supports recording microphone and system sound separately or simultaneously. The "Options" button is for you to adjust the volume and microphone device.

![recexpert record options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/recexperts-record-options.jpg)

Step 4\. If you want to record the webcam simultaneously, click on the "Webcam" icon at the bottom of the interface. Tap on the button to enable the webcam recording, and there will be a drop-down menu to select the recording device. Click on "OK" to confirm your settings.

Step 5\. When you turn back to the main interface, click on the "REC" button to start recording. A floating toolbar offers you buttons to pause or stop the recording during the recording process. In addition, the camera icon can be used to take screenshots, and the timer icon can help you stop recording automatically.
