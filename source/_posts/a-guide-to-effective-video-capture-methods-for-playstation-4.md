## Way 3\. How to Record Video on PS4 with Capture Card

If you do not want to install a PS4 emulator on your computer, you can purchase a capture card to connect your PS4 to your computer.

In fact, there are some capture cards that have inbuilt screen recorder. Here are the steps to follow for gameplay recording PS4 using Capture card.

Step 1: Connect PS4, capture card and your computer through HDMI cable.

Step 2: The USB or data cable should go from Capture card to your computer. The PS4 should be connected to your TV.

Step 3: Turn on PS4 and go to Settings on your TV screen. From Settings, go to System> System Information to check if PS4 software is updated. This is to ensure that what you see on your TV screen should also be on your laptop.
