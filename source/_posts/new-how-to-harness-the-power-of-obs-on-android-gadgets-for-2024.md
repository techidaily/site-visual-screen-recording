A thorough, well-rounded video content strategy comprises more than only the pre-recorded material that takes hours of planning, recording, and editing. OBS Studio is a superb broadcasting application that you may employ to record your games and share them in a straightforward, quick, and stream approach. One of the main issues when trying to shoot videos directly on your Android smartphone is that it generates substantial delay especially when you try to capture in real-time. OBS Studio (Open Broadcaster Software) is an application that allows you to record your video games and broadcast yourself over the Internet using sites such as the popular Twitch TV. You don't have a dedicated webcam or costly streaming camera? Whatever your purpose may be, you simply wish to employ your Android mobile phones or tablet computer's built-in camera using Open Broadcaster Software

The fundamental answer is No. Your approach should also feature some high-quality live streaming material, such as live event coverage, business announcements, and conferences.

You need to download an app that mirrors your phone’s screen to your PC, and then you can window capture the PC component of that program using OBS.
