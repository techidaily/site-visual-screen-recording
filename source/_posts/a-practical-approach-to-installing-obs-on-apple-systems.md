## A Practical Approach to Installing OBS on Apple Systems

OBS Studio has evolved into one of the most powerful audio recording software on the market today. Using OBS game capture, you may record screen games for YouTube videos or share snippets of gameplay with your friends for free. With this article, we'll cover how to record in OBS and how much storage space you'll need for your recordings. With OBS, it's easy to keep track of high scores, great in-game performances, and even tips on how to play like a pro quickly and effectively. Since gamers may use several third-party screen-recording techniques when recording their games, learning how to record gameplay using OBS is an ideal solution. An open-source tool called OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) will be utilized in this lesson.

It is widely utilized by both large and small broadcasters throughout the world because of its reliability as a streaming solution. Despite this, it's an effective tool for capturing images. OBS Studio enables you to record video directly to your device instead of broadcasting your screen. The days of framed screenshots and complex settings are over. Video game streamers and teachers with a lot of video presentations are likely to be acquainted with the OBS Studio. However, due to the complex user interface, it's a little tough for beginners to utilize. The good news is that there are a variety of OBS options to pick from. When it comes to performance, it's on par with other, more costly options. For the most part, the program allows for live streaming to several sites, such as Facebook Live and Hitbox.

## 2\. Best OBS Settings for Mac

OBS Studio is a complex software that comes with pre-installed screencasting capabilities. Free software often lacks the breadth of features required for flawless broadcasting, but not with OSB Studio. Even though the program is free, it features all of the crucial components that characterize online broadcasting. Many additional parts and modules will be given by the software now and then. That suggests it's really necessary to dabble and refresh with it. Else, you can experience a few hassles in using OBS correctly.

**Step 1: Launch and Create Output Recorder Setup**

Add on the Plus symbol and create the project. If you want to activate audio monitoring in OBS Studio: Right-click in the Output box, Open the Output mode or you can also go for Advanced Audio Properties:

![output recorder setup](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/output-recorder-setup.jpg)

**Step 2: Customize Record Only Feature**

In OBS for Mac, this setting will deliver the sound of the source to the Desktop as it were. Work area sound should be enabled for the sound to be captured. As soon as you activate this option, navigate towards the recording interface.

Then, under "recording path," select the "output" option to specify the spot on your computer where you desire to keep the recordings. Right after that, press the Record button to start recording your Game Audio in parallel.

## 3\. How to Record Screen with OBS on Mac

OBS Studio is open-source, free software that is worth a try for all users. This strategy may be used to solve the problem if you have two graphics cards, one of which is NVIDIA. The OBS black screen is most likely caused by OBS and the game you desire to record running on different graphics cards in this situation.
