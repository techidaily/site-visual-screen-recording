 Our professional lives often get hectic, which is why it is easy to overlook an important meeting. Planning is one of the key steps to success, and professionals from different industries use calendar services to keep track of their upcoming meetings.

 You don’t have to worry about missing a meeting if you are using Zoom to communicate with your business associates. Syncing your calendar with this [video conferencing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) will enable you to know exactly how many meetings you have scheduled on a particular day at all times.

## How to Sync Zoom Meetings to a Calendar on iOS Devices?

 All Zoom meetings you added to the Calendar app on your iPhone and iPad can be synced with the Zoom app. In addition, Zoom will send you reminders before a meeting, if you enable this option.

 All you have to do in order to sync your calendar with the iOS version of Zoom is to launch the app and tap on the Settings icon. Go to the **Meetings** menu and tap on the **Synced Calendars** option.
