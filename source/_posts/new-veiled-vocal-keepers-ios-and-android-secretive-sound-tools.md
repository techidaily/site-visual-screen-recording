## Veiled Vocal Keepers: IOS & Android Secretive Sound Tools

In todayâ€™s world, you cannot prove anything to anyone unless you have concrete evidence. There are so many times we face situations in life where we have no witness to testify, and we wish we could have a secret voice recorder device. The world has moved on from a secret voice recording device to a secret voice recording app. This is because we have our smartphones with us all the time. All you need is a voice recorder app to record any conversation without getting suspected.

However, a regular voice recorder app is not enough as any person around you could notice your phone screen and understand that you are recording. Instead, you need a secret voice recording app that can record in the background when the display is off. You can also record voice calls with such a voice recorder app without the other person getting any alert. We have compiled the list of best secret voice recorder apps for Android and iOS.
