It can streamline all business communication needs and lets you **record skype meeting** directly from the app if you’re working from home or remotely and you want to capture meeting minutes or a presentation, study group discussions or a lecture, or preserve family moments forever.

You can take advantage of the recording feature to save yourself from constantly taking notes haphazardly, jotting one thing, and missing another important point in an online lecture for example. Here I’ll be introducing an amazing piece of software to record skype meeting. You will learn:

## Part 2: How to Record Skype Meeting on Windows

Skype for Business allows you to record skype meetings on Windows PCs directly from its app. It’s an easy and straightforward method of recording your meeting and I’ll go through every step to show you how you can record your next Skype meeting.
