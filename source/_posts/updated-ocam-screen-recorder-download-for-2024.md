Step 4\. This software also provides you with a game recording option and an Audio recording option to meet different needs.

**PROS**

* You can eventually capture the full screen or a window zone of your PC
* The capacity to record sound makes it simple to describe or comment on onscreen movement, or you can skirt the sound and add your soundtrack later.
* Plenty of choices make oCam simple to modify. A few customizations include Watermarks, Languages, Hotkeys, and Mouse Effect, just as video settings like Time limit. Encoding alternatives incorporate multi-center handling, sound piece rate, and much more.
* Utilizing oCam's underlying codecs, you can determine formatting codecs, including a page of codecs suggested by the designer.
* Onscreen documentation appears machine-deciphered, or somewhat in this way, and scarcely comprehensible in places. The promotions by Google take up a ton of screen space and impede the documentation, as well.
* OCam permits you to record sound and video, as well. You can likewise make a few acclimations to the recording you make with this device, as you'll have the option to describe and even add your soundtrack to the recording you make.
* It is great on the off chance that you need to make instructional exercises on the most proficient method to make things.

**CONS**

* There are not as many editing options when compared to other systems
* After shutting oCam, the screen catch window vanished. Clicking Capture created an abnormal mistake message: "Not found the record target window."
* There's a file size limit of 155.9GB.
