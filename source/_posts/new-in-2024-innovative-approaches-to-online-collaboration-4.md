## Innovative Approaches to Online Collaboration (#4)

Google Hangouts is a popular platform for digital communication, and the platform is widely used by professionals for text conversations and video meetings. Google Hangouts is highly suitable for connecting with team members, and they organize daily meetings to allocate daily work, check work status, discuss project details and likewise. In fact, there are many companies that organize online seminars, and you can record Google Hangout sessions so that you can view them any time you want.

Apart from meetings and webinars, you can record Hangout calls as per your requirement. In order to record on Google Hangouts, you can do it directly through the default recording option available on Google Hangouts from your computer. If you want to record from your phone, there are different methods to follow. In this article, we will illustrate how to record Google hangout on different devices.

If you have a subscription to any of these two services, here are the steps for Google hangout recording
