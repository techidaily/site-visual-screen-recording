## Way 3\. How to Record Facebook Live on iPhone

Screencasts on iOS devices, such as the iPhone and iPad, are often done through third-party applications. However, for those who prefer a more direct method, the iOS 11 or 12 versions have a handy built-in screen recording option. However, before you can utilize this function, you must first enable it. You've come to the correct spot if you're wondering how to record Facebook videos on your iPhone. We'll now look at how you can do each of these tasks with ease. We'll be utilizing an app for that. Instead of going through the app's features, we'll go right into the steps.

### Steps to Record on iPhone

We'll look at how to enable the feature and make the most of it in this article:

Step 1: Enabling the Screen Recording Option

Check that the screen recording capability is accessible in the control center before utilizing it. You must activate this symbol if you do not see it. On your iOS device, open the Settings app. Select Control Center and then Customized Controls from the drop-down menu.
