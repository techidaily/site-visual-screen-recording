## Streamlining Your Workflow with Mac's Finest Snipers

Screenshots have become so ubiquitous that we don't pay much attention to them anymore. Yet, we use them day-in and day-out to show, explain, and communicate. Screenshots help us enrich and liven up our daily communication, whether it's sharing an image of a software bug with customer support, sending a quick how-to GIF to a colleague, or writing a heartfelt joke to a loved one.

Many Mac users need a widely-rated, multi-use MacBook snipping tool. All Mac users should know how to use the snipping tools, especially sales representatives and customer service representatives who use screenshots for product demos and troubleshooting. The simplest way to share your screen on Mac is by taking a screenshot.

However, a Mac user must use a snipping tool to take pictures. Despite the popularity of the Windows Snipping Tool, Mac users have been wondering how to use it. The good news is that there are several snipping tools tailored to Mac's system requirements. In this article, we will look at the list of some of the best snipping tools for MAC.

### 1.Snagit

As far as screen capturing software goes, Snagit is the gold standard. Due to its attractive interface and powerful features, it is very popular with corporate customers. Among its many features are screen recording and editing. An important aspect of the app is its intuitive user interface.

The top of your screen displays a small control panel. Screenshots can be taken, settings can be changed, and hotkeys customized. The editor provides several useful tools, including callouts, arrows, blur, and others. From the app, you can also create animated gifs and videos. The process of capturing and editing images and videos on a Mac is seamless that even the least tech-savvy user will find it easy to use.

There are several ways to capture your screen with Snagit. An entire screen can be captured, a specific area, or a specific application. Scanners and cameras can also be used to import images. An awesome feature of this snipping tool for Mac is the possibility of capturing text from a photo and pasting it into a text editor. You have to pay $50 to access all features, which is quite expensive when compared with other tools.

### 2.Lightshot
