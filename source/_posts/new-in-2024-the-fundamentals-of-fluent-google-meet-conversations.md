There are times when individuals have something very essential to share with the participants in the meeting, however, it just is not their turn to talk. During times such as these, the Google Meet chat feature can come in very handy!

While using a laptop or desktop computer, using the chat feature is very easy. All you have to do is just simply join the meeting that you are supposed to.

Once you have joined the session, look towards the bottom right-hand side of your screen. Over there you will see numerous options, but do not get confused. Make your way over to the speech bubble sign, and click on that, as shown in the image below.

## Part 3: How to Create a Group Chat on Google Meet?

While there is no way to create a group chat on Google Meet directly, what individuals can do is create a hangout and then turn on videos. This way people of a certain group can video call as well as chat simultaneously.

Google Meet comes fully equipped with numerous features and functions, however, changing the chat font size is not one of them. Participants cannot make any changes to the font of messages sent in the chatbox. They cannot increase the size, spacing, font style, or color of the messages that are being sent. While these options are available in other Google Application features such as Gmail and more. They are still yet to come into play on Google Meet.

## Part 6: How to Add Emojis to Google Meet Chat?

Want to make your messages on Google Meet slightly quirky or funny, why not add an emoji to spice things up! Emojis are the perfect way to grab attention to pressing messages, which individuals might overlook otherwise. You may have noticed that the Google Meet chat feature does not have an emoji button visible to you, however, you can still send emojis on Google Meet.

Simply join the meeting that you would like to become a part of.

Once you have joined the Google Meet session, make your way over to the bottom right side of your screen and locate the speech bubble icon and click that.
