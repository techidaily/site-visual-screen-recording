<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 11. [Bewisse](https://record.bewisse.com/)

Lewis is a smart-but-friendly looking free online screen recorder service that is entirely free. Unfortunately, it isn’t compatible with the Microsoft Edge internet browser, which is weird.

### 9. [Vidyard Online Screen Recorder](https://www.vidyard.com/free-screen-record/)

Unlike the others on our list so far, Vidyard lets you combine the online and offline sides of things. You can record and create new videos on your own – or you can pull something off the internet for quickness or help you remember important information. In addition, Vidyard lets you track your views, manage analytical data, and even embed your videos in other places.

**Pros**:

* The embed feature lets you monetize videos online without resorting to the main video watching/sharing websites.
* The analytical feedback lets you monitor the impact of your video so you can respond to the content.
* You can create your content, essentially making videos of your own.

**Cons**:

* It’s not a dedicated, exclusive screen recording platform.
* You can install it for free, but you need to pay for better features.

### 10\. Screenr

Screenr is remarkable because it excels in the annotation. Annotating is a hard thing to get right without confusing the user. Screenr manages to do it well, without all of the getting lost, undoing your notes, and having to add them again offline. It also allows seamless file sharing, which is excellent if you are a lecturer or a project manager.

**Pros**:

* This is a high-performing platform that is programmed for speed.
* One-click capture and share of annotations.
* A significant focus on document annotations that make it clean-cut and professional.

**Cons**:

### 11. [Bewisse](https://record.bewisse.com/)

**Pros**:

* You don’t need to set up an account with them, log in, or give away any details.
* There is no installation required to use it.
* It is entirely free to use.

**Cons**:

* It’s a little on the primary side.
