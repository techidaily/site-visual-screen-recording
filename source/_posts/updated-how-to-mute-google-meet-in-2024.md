## Part 4: How to Mute All Participants in Google Meet?

Want to convey your message to everyone without having some interrupt you and have you lose your train? Mute everyone!

Important Note: Host Management should be turned on prior to the commencement of the meeting to use the Google Meet Mute option to mute all participants at the same time. Additionally, the Google Meet mute all function is only available for Educational accounts and it can only be used by meeting creators and owners of the calendars.

At the button right of your Google Meet window, click on “people” and then click the “Mute all” button.

Don’t you just hate it when there is too much distortion or disturbance in a session because of another participant? Well, lucky for everyone, Google Meet has a “remove from the meeting” feature as well. In this, individuals can remove other people from the meeting, if they aren’t meant to be in the session or if they are causing challenges in the meeting. They can do this while being the host and even when they are not the host of the meeting.

### 1\. How to Remove Someone While Being The Host?

In the Google Meet window, click on the people icon and a list of participant names will appear on the screen.

![ Google Meet participants](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-participants-list-menu.jpg)

You will see 2 options, Pin to screen and Remove from meeting. Click on 2nd option to remove the participant and confirm the command.
