Ans. When you record your voice and insert the audio file to match the slides of your presentation, it is called a voice-over recording. You must ensure that the volume is enabled when you are recording the audio; else, when you start playing the presentation, there will be no sound.

As a result, your entire production will fail. Hence you must know how to voice over a PowerPoint before making a presentation.

**Q4\. How to voice over a PowerPoint on PC?**

Ans: If you want powerpoint voice recording, you need to follow the steps:

* You can either open a new PowerPoint file or an existing file.
* Select Insert from the toolbar
* Click on Audio
* Now, click on the Record option
* Click on start to start the recording
* Click on stop once the process is complete.

**Q5\. Why are recorded PowerPoint presentations more flexible?**

Ans: Recorded PowerPoint presentations are more flexible because you can pause them and explain them to your clients while the presentation is on. Moreover, you will not be distracted during the presentation. It is because your voice-over is already there in the presentation. So no matter how much distraction is there, the flow carries on.

A voice-over PowerPoint presentation is helpful when presenting to your clients virtually. If they have any questions, they can always ask after watching the entire slide show.
