## Practical Approach: Switching Video Orientation in VLC

VLC Media Player is more than just a regular video player that plays videos of different file formats. Apart from playing offline videos, VLC Media Player lets you stream videos from online sources as well as convert videos into different file formats. Besides, there are graphics equalizer and audio normalization available. But one feature that clearly stands out is **VLC rotate video** and save the video file.

You can rotate a video in VLC clockwise at 90, 180, and 270 degrees. The player also allows you to rotate videos at any arbitrary angle as per your requirement. In fact, you can flip the video horizontally and vertically as well as transpose the video as per your preference. Transposing a video means you are flipping and rotating at the same time. Rotating video in VLC is super easy, and in this article, we will explain the steps in detail.

## Part 1\. How to Rotate Video in VLC on Windows

There are various reasons why you may want to rotate a video. It could be that the video has been taken at the wrong angle or you want to watch the video at a certain angle from a different perspective. The most common reason is that the video is taken in portrait mode and it looks small on your computer screen with black screen on both sides and you want to rotate the video to landscape mode. Here are the steps to perform VLC rotate video.

Step 1: Open VLC Media Player.

Step 2: Go to Media > Open File option and select the video file that you want to rotate.

Step 3: Once the video opens, go to Tools > Effects and Filters option.

![vlc tools option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-tools-option.jpg)

Step 4: From Adjustments and Effects window, go to Video Effects tab.

Step 5: Under Video Effects tab, go to Geometry tab.

Step 6: Check Transform option and from the drop-down menu, select the required options.

In order to disable this rotation effect, follow the same steps and this time, uncheck Transform and Rotate options.
