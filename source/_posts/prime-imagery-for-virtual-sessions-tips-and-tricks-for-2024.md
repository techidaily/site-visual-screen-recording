## Part 3: How to Add A Virtual Background for Google Meet?

Adding a virtual background on Google Meet is a fairly simple task. Here’s how!

Important: Note that if you are entering the meeting without logging into your Google account, and if you require a knock to get admitted into the meeting, you will not be able to use this feature. Also, users who join Google Workspace for educational meetings, can not select their virtual backgrounds for Google Meet.

First, open the Google Meet session and enter into the meeting. At the bottom of your window click on the 3-dots option and click the “Apply visual effects” option from there.

To [blur your backgrounds](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) slightly or completely, you can click the blur buttons accordingly. If you want to opt for the built-in backgrounds, click on any of the backgrounds offered by Google Meet that you like the best.

However, if you want to add your own virtual background from your device then click “Add”.

Once you have chosen your photo for your background, click done and you are good to go!

Tip: Using virtual background for Google Meet may sometimes drain the battery of your device faster and slow it down, to avoid that, turn off your background.

## Part 4: How to Remove A Virtual Background From Google Meet?

Not feeling comfortable with a virtual background in your meeting? Don’t worry, you can always remove it! Here’s how!

Click at the 3-dots you can see at the window of your self-view and click on the “Change Background” button from the options.

Once the background options appear on your screen, click the option with a cross on it to remove the virtual background.
