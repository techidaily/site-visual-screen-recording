## 2\. Key Features of SplitCam

Even though it is a completely free video recorder, there are loads of useful features for the users. Here are the key features of SplitCam that you should be aware of.

Record From Different Sources ‚Äì You can record webcam video, desktop screen, IP camera, web browser screen, as well as your gameplay. Besides, you can record audio from different sources. In fact, you can record another video, image, PDF document, slideshow, and much more in the background.

Video Effects ‚Äì There are loads of video effects available to apply to webcam videos. Besides, there are realistic 3D masks available, and you can replace heads and faces with 3D objects. This will enhance the video content and allow you to create fun videos.

Live Streaming: With Splitcam, you can live stream to different video services like Justin.tv, UStream, and Livestream instantly. Besides, SplitCam allows you to use webcam with several applications without any issue. You can also upload your video to YouTube instantly.

Useful Features: The zoom feature is really great for highlighting the needed part. When you are making explanatory video, the zooming feature is a necessity for everyone to focus on the right part. Besides, you can capture screenshots instead of video as well. The software also shows the performance parameters for better understanding.

HD recording ‚Äì SplitCam lets you record the desired video from any video source as per the video resolution you need. The software supports up to 2048x1536 video resolution. You can adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, sharpen, and other parameters to enhance the video quality.

Moreover, you can use hotkeys to operate the software smoothly, and the user interface is quite simple and easy to operate.

## 3\. In-depth Review

Let us move on to the detailed SplitCam review and analyze how it performs on the parameters that matter the most.

Performance: SplitCam is not as heavy an application as some of the professional video recorders. Hence, it does not put much pressure on CPU resource. Since the video recording quality is restricted, even at the highest resolution, performance is smooth.

Video Quality: The video quality is restricted to maximum of 2048x1536 resolution. Therefore, you cannot shoot 4K videos even though your webcam or desktop screen has 4K resolution. Hence, there is a scope for improvement in video quality which is why users look for other SplitCam similar software.

Support Devices: You can record your external webcam, desktop screen, as well as IP camera. Besides, it supports NDI devices. However, the software is only available for Windows 7 and Windows 10.

Editing Options: There are different customization options available for adjusting video parameters such as brightness, saturation, and even skin smoother. However, it lacks editing options post-recording so that you could take the video to the next level.
