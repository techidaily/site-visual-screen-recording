## Part 5\. Alternative Way to Record Computer Screen

If you are not satisfied with the limited features of free Screen App IO and you have decided to spend some to purchase a professional screen recorder, we recommend [Filmora Screen Recording Program](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Filmora is both a screen recorder as well as a video editor. Therefore, after recording the video, you can add sound effects, video effects, filters, transitions and much more.

The video quality is not super high, but it gets the job done. There are various standard features available, but even the premium plan has several limitations. It is available for free and therefore, you should give it a try. If you are not satisfied, you can opt for Wondershare Filmora for professional-quality screen recording.
