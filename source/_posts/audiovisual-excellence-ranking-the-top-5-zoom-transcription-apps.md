Creating Zoom recording or **Zoom transcription**  is an easy way to keep your conversations documented. Once the participants of a meeting are informed that everything has been recorded, and they don’t need to take notes of the discussions, they automatically start focusing on the speaker of the host.

Another advantage of having **Zoom meeting transcription**  is that it can be referred to anytime you miss out on some parts during the implementation of the process the attendees of the conference had agreed upon.

Keeping the above in mind, following is a list of some of the best **Zoom call transcription**  software that can be used to **transcribe Zoom meeting**  with efficiency and least efforts. One of the following sections also discusses a few tips and tricks for the best transcription.

### 1. Automatic Audio Transcription in Zoom

Zoom is capable of recording your meetings and conferences, and storing them onto its Cloud server from where they can be obtained and manipulated as needed.

#### Prerequisites of using the Automatic Audio Transcription in Zoom

![Transcribe  Zoom Cloud Recording with Rev ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-transcription-software-rev.jpg)

Furthermore, the web interface shows the expected turnaround time and the cost of transcription on a per-minute basis.

### 3. [Happy Scribe](https://www.happyscribe.co/)

With decent star-rating, Happy Scribe is another online transcription tool that enables you to **transcribe Zoom meeting**  within a couple of minutes. At the time of this writing, the web app charges €12.00 for every 60-minute audio that it transcribes.

In order to avail the services, you are required to recharge your membership with the credits that are automatically deducted from your Happy Scribe account every time you transcribe Zoom audio. The Auto-Recharge feature that the vendor offers automatically recharges your account with your pre-defined amount as soon as it detects that your credit balance is below 30-minutes of transcription.

To transcribe, all you need to do is, upload the audio (\*.MP4) file to Happy Scribe, pick the language of the source audio, and click “Transcribe” to begin the process. Once completed, you can easily download the transcribed file to your PC.

### 4. [3PlayMedia](https://www.3playmedia.com/)

This online **Zoom meeting transcription**  tool comes with two plans where the first one charges on a per-transcription basis while the second is a prepaid subscription plan for enterprises that have regular meetings to transcribe.

3PlayMedia also allows you to [add close or open captions](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to the recorded video conferences that can be enabled/disabled or remain persistent throughout the videos respectively.

To transcribe meetings, you must sign in to your 3PlayMedia account, go to “Upload Media” to upload the file(s) you want to transcribe. Pick additional services (optional), choose your captioning type (optional), select your preferred turnaround time (choosing fast delivery costs more), agree to the terms of service, and click “Place Order”.

### 5. [Temi](https://www.temi.com/)

Temi is another online [speech-to-text](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) conversion tool that can **transcribe Zoom meetings**  in merely a couple of minutes. The web tool is capable of encrypting your files for secure transmission, thus keeping your information secured.

## Tips for Transcribe Zoom Meeting Recordings

Although the programs discussed above are efficient in their own way, they can generate accurate transcription only if the source files are healthy. Following are a few tips you must keep in mind while recording a Zoom meeting for transcription:

#### Tip 1: Get a Clear Audio Recording

Make sure that you follow the best practices about the input and output device placements and positioning suggested by Zoom professionals. While using a smartphone, ensure that it has enough battery to last at least for a couple of hours, and doesn’t exhaust during the meeting. For laptops, it is advisable to use an average quality headset with a microphone instead of onboard speakers and mic.

#### Tip 2: Meeting Transcription Software Security

While subscribing for any third-party transcription service, make sure to check their privacy policies and confirm if they are agreeable. Since you will be uploading quite sensitive information that may contain your trade secrets, only the service provider with good privacy policy and robust encryption algorithms should be allowed to handle your files.

**Conclusion**

**Zoom transcriptions**  come in handy when you plan to discuss some crucial matters in a meeting, and want all the details to be documented with proper timestamps. In case it is a video conference that is to be recorded, you can choose a service provider that offers close and open captioning as well.

Keeping the above in mind, following is a list of some of the best **Zoom call transcription**  software that can be used to **transcribe Zoom meeting**  with efficiency and least efforts. One of the following sections also discusses a few tips and tricks for the best transcription.

## Tips for Transcribe Zoom Meeting Recordings

Although the programs discussed above are efficient in their own way, they can generate accurate transcription only if the source files are healthy. Following are a few tips you must keep in mind while recording a Zoom meeting for transcription:

#### Tip 1: Get a Clear Audio Recording

Make sure that you follow the best practices about the input and output device placements and positioning suggested by Zoom professionals. While using a smartphone, ensure that it has enough battery to last at least for a couple of hours, and doesn’t exhaust during the meeting. For laptops, it is advisable to use an average quality headset with a microphone instead of onboard speakers and mic.

#### Tip 2: Meeting Transcription Software Security

While subscribing for any third-party transcription service, make sure to check their privacy policies and confirm if they are agreeable. Since you will be uploading quite sensitive information that may contain your trade secrets, only the service provider with good privacy policy and robust encryption algorithms should be allowed to handle your files.

**Conclusion**

**Zoom transcriptions**  come in handy when you plan to discuss some crucial matters in a meeting, and want all the details to be documented with proper timestamps. In case it is a video conference that is to be recorded, you can choose a service provider that offers close and open captioning as well.
