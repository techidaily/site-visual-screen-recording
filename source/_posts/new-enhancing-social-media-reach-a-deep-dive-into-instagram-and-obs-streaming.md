## Enhancing Social Media Reach: A Deep Dive Into Instagram & OBS Streaming

Instagram is steadily becoming a great video content platform against the popular belief that it is merely a photo posting platform. In fact, it has become an equally popular platform among creators and brands as YouTube. That is why creators are willing to upload creative videos and go for live streaming to engage the audiences and get brand deals. You should live stream to Instagram from OBS Studio if you want to stream from your computer.

Instagram is primarily a mobile app and Instagrammers live stream from their smartphones. However, just like YouTube, you can live stream from your computer if the popular Instagrammers are doing these days. You need OBS Studio which is available for free and it is compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux. In this article, we will illustrate how to use OBS to Instagram live in simple steps.
