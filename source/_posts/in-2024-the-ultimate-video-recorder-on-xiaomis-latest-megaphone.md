## Part 1: How to Record Screen on Xiaomi Smartphones?

Before we get into the Xiaomi screen recorder APK, it is essential to understand how Xiaomi came into the field to create a brand name.

Founded in 2010, Xiaomi Inc. has changed the narrative of regular Android devices in the market. In a short time interval, this company became a global product that offers honest prices for Android lovers. Xiaomi has multiple features that give it uniqueness as compared to other devices. The screen recording feature is one of the most workable traits of the lot.

Screen recording has become a need these days as everything seems to be occurring online. Everything is under the shadow of video and audio recording, from meetings to classes and exams to conferences. So, without delaying the process any longer, let us switch our focus to the process of screen recording on Xiaomi smartphones.

### Step 1: Screen Recording Feature in the Control Centre

You have to bring the "Screen Recording" feature to the Control Centre in the first step. Hold your Xiaomi smartphone and access the Control Centre. The user can swipe the screen from top to bottom to open it.

### Step 2: Editing the Shortcuts on Control Centre

The top right side of the Control Centre offers a pen-shaped icon just beside the “Settings” icon. Click on it and the bottom panel will display “Available Toggles,” where “Screen Recorder” would be present.
