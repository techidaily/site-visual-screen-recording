* **Account**

Using your personal account rather than the workplace account is better to use maximum filters, effects, and masks. Duo-style filters, AR masks, to name a few, are features that can be easily applied when using Google Meet through personal accounts.

* **Operating system**

Some visual filters and masks are only to be enjoyed when you join video sessions through Android and iOS apps. This means you may not be able to access them through internet browsers.

* **Participation in a video call**

To use filters and effects, you must be a participant in the Google Meet session. So, you must log in preferably through your personal Gmail account to enjoy unlimited filters, effects, and masks.
