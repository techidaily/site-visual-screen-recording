After recording the game screen, you can edit the video and upload it on social media and video streaming platforms.

**Free Music Addition**

One of the main reasons why a good-quality video stands out from a basic video is the background music. You will find only a few screen recorders and video editors to add free music in the background of the video as per your preference and requirements. This makes the video soothing and pleasant to the ears rather than just being pleasant to the eyes. There is no need to search online for free music to add to your screen recordings as you can find suitable music for your video from Ezvid library.

**Control Video Speed**

You know how important it is to regulate video speed so that the crucial moments are recorded at a slow speed while not so important parts can be at a high speed. There are only a few screen recorders available that allow users to control video speed. This is a necessary feature professional video creators always look for in a screen recording and video editing software.

**Instant Slideshow Maker -**

Instead of making and editing videos all the time, you can also use Ezvid to make slideshows using screenshots and photos. There are beautiful transitions and effects available and you can add texts and drawings. You can make the slideshows instantly and share them with anyone on any platform. Therefore, Ezvid video maker can be used as a screen recorder as well as slideshow maker.

Besides, you can add voice over to the recorded video to make it more professional and interesting.

## 3\. Alternative Tool to Record Screen

While Ezvid screen recorder is good enough, Wondershare Filmora is simply better. You can record screen up to HD resolution while Filmora [Screen Recorder](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) lets you record up to 4K resolution. Naturally, the video quality is going to be stunning and it is crucial in gameplay recording. Ezvid has no option to record only a specific part of the screen that Filmora comes with. There are simply better filters, effects, and transitions available on Filmora.

Apart from giving voiceover, you can record your audio live with a microphone and use green screen technology using Filmora. Moreover, Filmora not just allows inserting of drawings but also captions and stickers. To sum it all up, Filmora is literally more professional for all perspectives, and therefore, Wondershare Filmora is the best alternative to Ezvid video maker.
