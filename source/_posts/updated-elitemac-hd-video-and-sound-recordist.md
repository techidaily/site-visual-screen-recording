Users will get to record the screen along with mic and system audio using this tool and while you are on it, you should know that it is just a recorder and not an editor. The interface that you will get is highly intuitive and user friendly where the recording process is extremely simple and straightforward.

How to record?

* Launch the Search and enter QuickTime Player. To get started with the recording, press and hold the Ctrl key, click on the app icon.
* Alternatively, you can open the app and click on the File button to screen record on Mac with audio. Click on the New Screen Recording button.
* It will greet you with a new compact dashboard that will offer a few controls for the screen recording. In the center, you will get a Record button with a few options in the dropdown menu to enable the mouse clicks.
* Here, you will also get to enable the mouse clicks to be recorded in the captured screen. It will help a lot of creators who are into creating guides and tutorials for their online audience.
* Once everything is set, it's time to hit the Record button and it will give you a drag & drop tool to make the screen selection. If you want to record the full screen, all you need to do is click anywhere on the screen to start recording.
