Step 4: If you want to trim the video, place the mouse point at the beginning or ending of the video from where you want to trim. When the trim icon appears, press and hold the mouse button and move forward or backward.

If the useless part is in the middle, you need to split the video using Scissor icon and apply the same method mentioned above to trim out unwanted parts.

Step 5: When you are done editing, click on Export and set all the parameters perfectly to save the video.

## Conclusion

If you are a Mac user, QuickTime player screen recording with audio is available for free of cost for you to record your screen activities. However, you will need to install an external extension for QuickTime player screen recording audio. If you want a better alternative, we recommend Wondershare Filmora where you can record the screen with audio and edit any video in simple steps.
