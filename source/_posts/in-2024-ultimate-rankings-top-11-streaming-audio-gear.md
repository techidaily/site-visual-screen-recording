## Ultimate Rankings: Top 11 Streaming Audio Gear

Meta: Looking for a way to record any streaming audio and save it on your hard drive? Here are the top 11 best streaming audio recorders.

That is where a streaming audio recorder comes into the scene.

A streaming audio recorder records whatever you are streaming on your computer. Therefore, you can stream your favorite song or motivational podcast, and the recorder will record streaming audio and let you save the file on your computer.
