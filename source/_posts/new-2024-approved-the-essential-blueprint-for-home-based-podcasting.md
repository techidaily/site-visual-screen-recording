Regardless of your platform, you might still want to utilize an audio editing application to polish and perfect your interviews. A crucial ability for a podcaster is to learn remote podcast recording. By informing your guests to utilize an external mic (USB mics are acceptable) and ensuring all noises and distractions are kept to a minimum, you can help screen your guests and get them ready for the interview.
