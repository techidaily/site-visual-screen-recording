Though there are many screen capture tools for Linux available on the market, to make things easier, consider the top 8 screen capture tools for Linux mentioned below. They are all excellent when it comes to user-friendliness, allowing you to take screenshots or record screens in a snap.

Some of these tools are only used to capture screenshots and edit the captured images, while some also allow you to capture the whole activity on your screen, namely, [record whatever happening on your Linux screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Hope it is helpful for you to find the best screen capture tool based on your needs.

Even if it is your first time using this screen shot tool, you will not experience any complication as it is built with the needs of users in mind.
