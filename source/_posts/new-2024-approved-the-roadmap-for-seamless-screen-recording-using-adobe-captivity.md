Standard Editing - Adobe screen capture software lets you edit the recorded video to add transitions, insert texts and images, draw smart shapes and highlight boxes, add voiceover and audio effects. You can add another video in Picture-in-Picture format, and you can publish your recorded and edited video on YouTube with a single click. Besides, you can add pan and zoom effects, trim video clips, and split video into different sections.
