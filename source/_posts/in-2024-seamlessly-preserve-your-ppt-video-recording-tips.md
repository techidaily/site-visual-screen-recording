## Seamlessly Preserve Your PPT: Video Recording Tips

A PowerPoint presentation is a series of slides used to organize and share information. Microsoft’s PowerPoint program for Windows comes with various customization options for creating a presentation. In addition to text, you can place images, tables, charts, videos, links, and other types of content in your PowerPoint presentation to really make it pop.

There have been complaints from PowerPoint users about not being able to have direct access to the full detail of the presentation after presenting. One of the most prominent problems is that users want to jot things down, and at the same time, they want to pay full attention to the presenter especially when the presentation is on ‘how to’. There is a tendency to miss little vital information. Also, those who miss presentations on PowerPoint have no hope of getting the presentation in detail.

Fortunately, there is a solution to the problem. Recording PowerPoint as a video is possible. It is an interesting and helpful idea that could help users go over the whole presentation and get the information as though the PowerPoint presentation is still live. The only difference will be the time at which they watched the presentation.

This article will:

1. Educate you on how to record PowerPoint presentations with video and audio, in a step-by-step approach.
2. Show you the benefits of recording PowerPoint presentations.
3. Teach you the advantages and disadvantages of using PowerPoint presentations with video and audio
4. Recommend a third-party tool to record PowerPoint presentations.

## Part I. When you will need to record a PowerPoint?

There are almost 35 million PowerPoint presentations delivered daily.

PowerPoint slides are the preferred method of delivering supplementary information that enables audiences to comprehend and relate to the concepts and ideas delivered in presentations, whether in classrooms or boardrooms. Presentations can take several forms, including

* Training and tutorials
* Business and sales presentations
* Executive communications
* Product demos
* Educational lectures
* Student assignments
* And more…

But after they are delivered, what happens to all of those PowerPoint slides? Depending on the content and target audience, a select few will be shared or preserved, either publicly on SlideShare or privately on SharePoint.

In most cases, PowerPoint slides on their own, without the corresponding presentation — are incomplete and don’t do the best job of communicating the concepts from the actual presentation. Those ahead of the curve should be to share and archive recordings of their full presentations.

## Part II. How to record a PowerPoint presentation with video and audio

You can record a presentation in real-time as you present, or do it in advance to leverage the flipped model or make your presentation available on-demand.

While there are several ways to record a presentation, this is one of the easiest ways to record a high-quality presentation in PowerPoint with audio and video.

##### Step1 Prepare Your PowerPoint Slides and Talking Points

Before recording your presentation, ensure your slides are organized correctly and error-free. The function of your PowerPoint presentation is to act as a visual aid for the information you’re presenting, not to present all your information for you. Don’t put too much info on your slides so you won’t be tempted to read directly from them.

The image below shows how your screen will look when your presentation is ready.

![prepare your powerpoint slides and talking points](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-record-a-powerpoint-presentation-2.jpg)

##### Step2 Select Your Audio and Video Sources

You can record video, audio, or just your slide show directly within the Microsoft PowerPoint program. After you’ve opened PowerPoint, select “Recording” from the top navigation bar. This will open a new navigation bar with “Record Slide Show” and “Screen Recording” options.

![select your audio and video sources](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-record-a-powerpoint-presentation-3.jpg)

If you just want to record your slideshow without adding audio or video, you would select “Record Slide Show”. Choosing “Screen Recording” will let you capture your slideshow while at the same time recording audio from your computer and any video on your computer screen.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** you can start recording from the beginning or you choose a current slide to start recording from.

##### Step3 Open Your PowerPoint Slides and Capture the Screen

Choose “Screen Recording,” and you’ll be given the opportunity to select the area on your screen you want to capture. Adjust the red box to fit your Powerpoint presentation. Once you have the box where you want it, you’re ready to record!

![open your powerpoint slides and capture the screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-record-a-powerpoint-presentation-4.jpg)

##### Step4 Press Record And Start Presenting

Make sure the “Audio” button appears gray before you hit the record button. Once you hit record, you’ll begin capturing everything in the area you’ve selected, and any audio picked up by your computer’s mic.

If you prefer, you can skip recording audio during this step and add it later. Use the “Audio” option from the PowerPoint navigation if you’re trying to find out how to record PowerPoint presentations with audio you’ve already recorded.

##### Step5 Export the video: to achieve this, follow the steps below

1. Navigate to File, click Export, and choose to Create a Video
2. Select the resolution
3. Set timing parameters or use recorded timings and narration
4. Click on Create Video
5. Choose Save as Type and select between MPEG-4 or Windows Media Video
