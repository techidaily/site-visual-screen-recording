### [Fraps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Fraps is another premium screen recorder where you need to pay one-time free only for unlimited recording. The software is particularly useful when you have not so high-end computer. You can record your screen as well as webcam. You can also customize resolution, frame per second rate, and much more.

There are hotkeys available for easy operation. The software shows various recording parameters in a corner while recording. You can also take screenshots with the software. However, there is no editing option available. If you have Windows XP or Windows 7, you can use Fraps to easily record your screen without any performance issue.

## Conclusion

ShareX is great if you want to capture screenshots of your current screen as well as record your screen. However, the settings are not highly customizable while recording and the lack of features is a huge concern if you want to record regularly. That is why we have recommended the best ShareX alternatives, and our top pick is Wondershare Filmora which is easy to use and feature-rich.
