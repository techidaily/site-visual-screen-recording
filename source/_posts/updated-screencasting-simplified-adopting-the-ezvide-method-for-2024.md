Instead of waiting for the screen recording to get over and editing the recorded video to add drawings, you can add the required drawings live while recording the screen with Ezvid screen recorder. This simple feature is going to save you a lot of time as there is no further editing required. There are ample drawings available to illustrate on the screen and draw the attention of the viewers in the highlighted areas.

**Gameplay Recording**

Apart from recording desktop screen as well as browser screen, there is a special and dedicated feature to capture the screen while playing games. The software comes with guided instructions on how to record gameplay for complete user convenience. Professional gamers may not get all the customization options but Ezvid gets the job done perfectly. After recording the game screen, you can edit the video and upload it on social media and video streaming platforms.

**Free Music Addition**

One of the main reasons why a good-quality video stands out from a basic video is the background music. You will find only a few screen recorders and video editors to add free music in the background of the video as per your preference and requirements. This makes the video soothing and pleasant to the ears rather than just being pleasant to the eyes. There is no need to search online for free music to add to your screen recordings as you can find suitable music for your video from Ezvid library.

**Control Video Speed**

You know how important it is to regulate video speed so that the crucial moments are recorded at a slow speed while not so important parts can be at a high speed. There are only a few screen recorders available that allow users to control video speed. This is a necessary feature professional video creators always look for in a screen recording and video editing software.

**Instant Slideshow Maker -**

Instead of making and editing videos all the time, you can also use Ezvid to make slideshows using screenshots and photos. There are beautiful transitions and effects available and you can add texts and drawings. You can make the slideshows instantly and share them with anyone on any platform. Therefore, Ezvid video maker can be used as a screen recorder as well as slideshow maker.

Besides, you can add voice over to the recorded video to make it more professional and interesting.
