This information will make your task easier:</p><h4 id="1-Taking-Game-Screenshots-with-Game-Bar-on-Windows-10"><a href="#1-Taking-Game-Screenshots-with-Game-Bar-on-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="1. Taking Game Screenshots with Game Bar on Windows 10"></a>1. Taking Game Screenshots with Game Bar on Windows 10</h4><p>If you are not interested in installing any additional tool on your gaming PC, it is even possible to capture high-quality game screenshots using Game Bar. While playing an adventure game, you first need to open the game bar; but it is easy to do with keyboard-based shortcuts. Simply press, Windows + Alt + Print Screen or it can also be done by hitting Windows + G keys. As soon as the Game Bar is open on your screen, hit the camera shaped button available on the bar; it is named “Screenshot.”</p><p>In case if you find it little difficult to open your game bar using these keys in between a game; Windows 10 also allows users to customize these keys as per their convenience. You can alter the shortcut keys by switching to Settings, then Gaming and finally Game Bar. As soon as you capture a screenshot using Game Bar, the system shows an instant notification “Screenshot saved,” it appears on the bottom right corner of the screen. All these screenshots are automatically saved at Captures&#x2F; Videos section along with all other videos that you have captured till now using Windows 10 Game Bar feature.</p><h4 id="2-Taking-Screenshots-Using-In-Game-Shortcuts"><a href="#2-Taking-Screenshots-Using-In-Game-Shortcuts" class="headerlink" title="2. Taking Screenshots Using In-Game Shortcuts"></a>2. Taking Screenshots Using In-Game Shortcuts</h4><p>In case if you are not playing games on Steam, it is still possible to capture screenshots with many built-in shortcuts and screenshot functions. In most of the games, the screenshot can be captured instantly using “Print Screen” key; however, few games may follow other settings for screen capture. As soon as you tap the key in question, the game will instantly save a screenshot at a specific location on the disk. For example, in all Blizzard’s Battle.net games, the Print Screen key always helps to capture a screenshot, and they can be later found in a hard drive-based folder. However, the folder name can be different for every game; for example, if you capture a screenshot while playing Overwatch, it will be saved at folder location: Documents\Overwatch\Screenshots\Overwatch. You can perform a web search to know the suitable screenshot key for every game. This information can also be obtained from the shortcut configuration menu.</p><h4 id="3-Taking-Screenshots-Using-Steam’s-Shortcut"><a href="#3-Taking-Screenshots-Using-Steam’s-Shortcut" class="headerlink" title="3. Taking Screenshots Using Steam’s Shortcut"></a>3. Taking Screenshots Using Steam’s Shortcut</h4><p>In case if you are playing your favorite game on Steam, it is possible to capture screenshots instantly by using the built-in screen capture feature of Steam. The great news is that capturing a screenshot with Steam is quite easier; you simply need to hit “F12” key on your keyboard. As soon as you press the key, a shutter sound will be heard on the system and a notification saying “Screenshot Saved” will appear instantly on the bottom right corner of PC screen.</p><p>In case if you do not find F12 key easier to access during your games, you can also customize this key by going to Steam Interface section. Go to settings and then In-Game and finally adjust the “Screenshot Shortcut Keys” option as per your requirement. If you want to view the captured screenshots, open them using Shift + Tab key on Steam Overlay; or if you have altered the settings on Steam, it can be done using your custom shortcut on the keyboard. Finally, click “View Screenshots” button on the overlay.</p><p>If you want to see your screenshots after exiting the game, you will find them on Steam library by opening game page. Simply scroll down towards bottom area of your game’s page, and the screenshots will be available with a “View Screenshot Library” option. You will be happy to know that it is possible to upload captured screenshots directly to Facebook using screenshot library. You can also find your captured screenshots using “Show on Disk” button.</p><h4 id="4-Capturing-Screenshot-with-Nvidia-GeForce-Experience"><a href="#4-Capturing-Screenshot-with-Nvidia-GeForce-Experience" class="headerlink" title="4. Capturing Screenshot with Nvidia GeForce Experience"></a>4. Capturing Screenshot with Nvidia GeForce Experience</h4><p>In case if you are working with Nvidia graphics, the chances are that your system also has Nvidia’s GeForce Experience software. This software tool is loaded with wide range of features and the screenshot capturing ability is one of them. In order to capture a game screenshot with Nvidia GeForce Experience, simply hit Alt + F1 key and the screenshot will get automatically saved into GeForce Experience Gallery. As soon as the screenshot is captured, the system also displays an instant notification about it saying “Screenshot has been saved to Gallery” on the top right side of your screen.</p><p>In order to view the captured screenshots, you can press Alt + Z button on your Windows system. Go to Gallery to view all your game screenshots; note that they will be saved along with the ShadowPlay Videos on your system. These screenshots can also be found under Videos\Name of the Game path along with videos that you have captured using GeForce Experience.</p><h4 id="5-Taking-Screenshot-with-Nvidia-Ansel"><a href="#5-Taking-Screenshot-with-Nvidia-Ansel" class="headerlink" title="5. Taking Screenshot with Nvidia Ansel"></a>5. Taking Screenshot with Nvidia Ansel</h4><p>There is no doubt to say that GeForce Experience provides a rich experience with its awesome features but here is another tool from Nvidia that can also help you to capture screenshots; however, it allows users to capture them using moving camera. Note that, this option works only with few specific games, only if the developer has added support for this feature. However, there are many popular games in the list that support Nvidia Ansel feature like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Middle-Earth: Shadow of War, Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice, Dishonored 2, etc.</p><p>When you are playing the game, simply hit Alt + F2 key and the gameplay will instantly freeze; along with this, “Ansel” sidebar will appear on the screen. Now you can adjust the screen for capturing region specific screenshot using drag and drop feature of a mouse or with the help of keyboard keys. In case if you are interested in adding a unique filter effect to your screenshot, it can be done by using various options available on the sidebar; gamers love to use sepia tone or wish to adjust the field of view for their captured shots. You can also make selections for whether you want to capture your game screenshots with a normal view or need super-resolution. Some of you may also be interested in capturing a 360-degree screenshot with Nvidia Ansel. These 360-degree screenshots can be later viewed via different methods like HTC Vive, Oculus Rift or using Google Cardboard Headset.</p><p>Hit the snap button, and your screenshots will be saved instantly; this system allows you to capture an unlimited number of shots with the paused screen. You can later view these screenshots by pressing Alt + Z key on your system or by simply clicking “Gallery” option. These screenshots are generally saved at Videos\Name of the Game path.</p><h4 id="6-Taking-Game-Screenshots-with-AMD-ReLive-Feature"><a href="#6-Taking-Game-Screenshots-with-AMD-ReLive-Feature" class="headerlink" title="6. Taking Game Screenshots with AMD ReLive Feature"></a>6. Taking Game Screenshots with AMD ReLive Feature</h4><p>In case if you are working on AMD graphics hardware, you can capture screenshots with the help of its ReLive Feature. Note that, this feature works only if you are using a desktop with AMD Graphics Core Next Architecture. However, it is not so fancy like Nvidia Ansel; the screen capture option is almost same as Steam or the Nvidia GeForce Experience. As soon as you are ready with ReLive, simply hit Ctrl + Shift + E button or use Alt + Z. Now click on the “Screenshot” option to capture the screenshot from your favorite game. It will be saved by default into videos folder on your system. You can share these screenshots later with your friends online to showcase your gaming adventure.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>Being a dedicated and crazy gamer, you may always be interested in sharing your gaming experiences with your friends online. It is now possible to capture screenshots on your system by using simple keyboard shortcuts.

Because of its name, it may seem to be a complex program, although it is quite popular among Windows users. This utility is also compatible with games that use OpenGL or DirectX graphics. When it comes to FRAPS, many things raise the standard, but the competition it provides to its counterparts while remaining affordable is unrivaled. Older versions of Windows, such as Windows XP, are also supported by FRAPS. This function is exceptional since it is not available in any other screen recorder. It is, on the other hand, simple to use and has a fluid drag-and-drop feature that elevates it to the top of the hierarchy.</p><p>Fraps is one of the most well-known third-party programs for PC gamers, thanks to its free and simple benchmarking features that can test the performance of almost any game. It’s also a simple method to put a frame rate counter in the corner of your screen to keep an eye on in-game performance second by second. FRAPS can capture up to 7680 x 4800 at bespoke frame rates ranging from 1 to 120 frames per second, making it stand out among its peers. Skype calls from online or video games are among the features available. It can also record sounds through a microphone, making it the most versatile of all the options thus far. There is no way to capture webcam footage or create a timeline. It also can’t add video titles or capture audio from the system. None of these drawbacks, we believe, are relevant to video game recording fans. FRAPS has numerous drawbacks despite its low cost and flexibility.</p><h2 id="1-Download-and-Install"><a href="#1-Download-and-Install" class="headerlink" title="1. Download and Install"></a>1. Download and Install</h2><p>Fraps can also record videos of your gaming sessions, but unlike the other tools in our overview of gameplay capture software, you must pay to use the program’s full video recording features. Minimized start, always on top view, show status on LCD, minimize to system tray exclusively, and more options are available under Fraps’ general settings. Games that utilize OpenGL and DirectX technologies are compatible with the system.</p><p>DOWNLOAD LINK: <a class="link"   href="https://fraps.com/" >FRAPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115937/19272" target="_top" id="2115937">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115937" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115937/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Fraps"><a href="#2-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Fraps" class="headerlink" title="2.

There are four tabs in this little window: General, FPS, Movies, and Screenshots.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fraps.jpg"                      alt="fraps"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144284/7443" target="_top" id="2144284">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144284" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144284/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Fraps’ benchmarking tools are located under the FPS tab. When Fraps is active, the framerate counter is always visible in-game. If you want to record a benchmark while playing, just press F11, but first adjust the benchmarking parameters under FPS &gt; Benchmark Settings to your desire.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fps.jpg"                      alt="fps"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148644/16836" target="_top" id="2148644">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148644" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148644/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> Stop the recording, then go to the Movies tab to see how Fraps is recording your game. Some choices are accessible in the free version, while others are not. The loop buffer length is deactivated, which allows you to use the hotkey to record the latest “X” seconds of gameplay. You may, however, choose whether you want a full-size or half-size recording and select the maximum frame rate when recording. You may also change the sound capture settings, record your microphone, hide or show the mouse pointer, lock the framerate while recording, and capture lossless RGB.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/movies.jpg"                      alt="movies"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100538/7443" target="_top" id="2100538">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100538" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100538/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#3-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="3.

Star Wars: Squadrons grants you the second of these fantasies to a never before seen degree. This long-overdue follow up to the 1993 classic Star Wars: X-Wing aims to offer the same intense dogfighting, but with the advantages of modern tech. I reviewed the PC version.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118314/7443" target="_top" id="2118314">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118314" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118314/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Some-tinkering-required"><a href="#Setup-Some-tinkering-required" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Some tinkering required"></a><strong>Setup: Some tinkering required</strong></h2><p> Star Wars: Squadrons has a fairly hefty download before it’s playable, so be sure your hard drive has at least 26.4 GB of storage space. When the game boots up you can alter basic settings to set language, volume, display settings, and everything else needed to optimize your experience. I struggled a bit to get it to play well with my dual-screen setup, but eventually, I was able to get it to a playable state on my ultra-widescreen Samsung CHG90 display. In the end, I found it more comfortable to play on a standard 16:9 aspect ratio monitor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1xt9t7ffMjuv6ggtXGJER_irSnk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-2-fcfb7e9a60e74ce9b42cecff0e2061ed.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036472/19272" target="_top" id="2036472">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036472" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036472/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Story-Passable-but-skip-the-exposition-dumps"><a href="#Story-Passable-but-skip-the-exposition-dumps" class="headerlink" title="Story: Passable, but skip the exposition dumps"></a><strong>Story: Passable, but skip the exposition dumps</strong></h2><p> The game picks up after the destruction of Alderaan in A New Hope. You get to play both sides of the conflict in alternating story missions as both an Imperial pilot and a Rebel pilot. Both characters are customizable with a range of preset options. I always appreciate it when a game gives me the option to create my own character.</p><p> The range of presets is fairly limited, but welcome nonetheless. As is traditional for me, I chose to rename the protagonists after characters from Terry Pratchett’s Discworld novels. The Rebel hero became Lu-Tze, with the evil Vorbis on the side of the Empire. I was happy to be able to find a suitably sinister British accent for Vorbis, though hilarious results are possible with mismatched voices and characters. In the end, though, you’ll be spending most of the game from a first-person perspective, with your character only briefly present in cutscenes.</p><p>Star Wars: Squadrons is drop-dead gorgeous.</p><p> Next, you can choose whether you’d like a more guided experience with the standard HUD, or if you’d prefer a more immersive and challenging experience. The game also offers a mode where only your cockpit instruments are displayed. It’s probably a good idea to start off in the standard mode until you get to grips with the controls and gameplay. Lastly, choose your difficulty setting (which will depend on your general experience with flight games), and you’re off to battle.</p><p> Squadrons starts off with an obligatory tutorial mission to teach you how to fly. Though it’s somewhat prolonged, the initial awe of the scenery of an Imperial battlegroup banishes any boredom that you might expect from a tutorial mission. Gliding around Star Destroyers and other classic Star Wars spaceships is quite an experience.</p><p> The story is passable, if not terribly deep or ambitious, and is basically there to connect the battle sequences and give context to the fight. Voice acting varies from mediocre to passable, and there’s clearly some effort put into establishing likeable characters. However, though the character models are good, there’s definitely a bit of the uncanny valley on display here, and it’s particularly noticeable in the first-person conversations where you stare dumbly on as an NPC spouts exposition at you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/_MN0adYtaTCJ1Qhmsivk-M-DkXo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-3-31074635684244d48b1d792540a477e2.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> In between story missions you are fixed in place in different rooms, where you click on different characters to talk to them. I found these sequences to be very linear and I found that they tended to drag on. I’d certainly have preferred to be able to walk around rather than teleport between locations on the ship. This is probably due to this game being intended to be played in VR where the fixed positioning makes more sense due to the limitations of VR, but the game would’ve been well served by separate control schemes. This is a minor gripe; if desired you can just skip through these sequences pretty quickly.</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Refined-and-surprisingly-deep"><a href="#Gameplay-Refined-and-surprisingly-deep" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Refined and surprisingly deep"></a><strong>Gameplay: Refined and surprisingly deep</strong></h2><p> The real meat of the game is in battle, and it’s an incredibly intense and immersive experience. Whatever system or control method you’re utilizing, there are a lot of different inputs and functions to learn. This would be daunting to newcomers, but the campaign does a great job of gradually introducing new controls and mechanics at a pace that makes them easy to pick up.</p><p> One of the most complex aspects of the game is team and system management, which involves making quick decisions about the layout of your ship and the behaviour of your allies. The basic power systems are easy to master, and simple “attack this” and “defend that” commands aren’t hard to learn, but there are more complicated systems as well that add a level of depth to the game for dedicated players.</p><p> Both the empire and rebels have a range of four classes of ships to choose from - a jack-of-all-trades fighter, a slow bomber with a fearsome arsenal of weapons, a fast and agile interceptor, and a support class ship. I really appreciated that the game doesn’t just make these reskinned mechanically identical clones for each faction. Instead, each side has its unique quirks that affect gameplay, and somehow the designers were still able to balance the game so that neither team feels outgunned by the other.</p><p> Dogfights are fast, brutal, and thanks to a wide variation in map design, each match feels remarkably fresh and non-repetitive. There is some of the traditional looping around in circles, but between the obstacles placed about the map, the different capabilities of the various ships, and the interaction between you and your teammates, this happens only occasionally.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/COT6eEVvzd6QqCbhmtbP4a_C--Q=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-6-9d086810906a486b9266ec247e2ab966-3636fb8670644ae98afd0bc57b59df8d.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> The one thing that pulled me out of the game at times was the somewhat wonky ship physics, which make sense from the pilot’s seat, but look a bit weird to see from other ships. You can stop quickly and turn on a dime, which benefits gameplay on a technical level, but is a bit jarring and unrealistic to witness.</p><p> One important aspect of gameplay is how Squadrons balances the fragility of its fighters with creating a fun experience. It does this using shields and repair kits that vary from ship to ship and which can be customized. It walks the fine line between allowing you to mow down enemy fighters without wailing away at them for ages, while also preventing you from feeling like you’re piloting a glass canon.</p><p> There’s also ship customization, which allows you to alter various aspects of your aircraft such as armament, hull, and engines to enhance various attributes, though this usually comes at a cost to other capabilities. For example, you can trade speed for extra agility and vice versa. It requires a deep understanding of the ship you’re customizing so you’ll probably want to wait to touch this till you’ve had plenty of practice in battle. There are also cosmetic customizations, such as paint jobs and ornaments. Both gameplay and cosmetic customizations are purchased with separate types of in-game currency.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Attention-to-detail"><a href="#Graphics-Attention-to-detail" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Attention to detail"></a><strong>Graphics: Attention to detail</strong></h2><p> Star Wars: Squadrons is drop-dead gorgeous. Ships are lovingly rendered and great detail was paid to getting the lighting, environments, and effects just right. The cockpits of the different ships you pilot are fully realized and mesmerizing in their realism. It’s easy to get sucked into ogling a grand alien vista or just reveling in the experience of being in the cockpit of an honest to goodness X-Wing. Explosions, lasers, enemy ships tearing apart in fiery gouts of flame, and the realistic damage to your own ship, provoke many tense situations that hit home and are bound to get your heart racing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/a-_aXPmbq5vlMG21Sutf0cIe4BI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-7-dc3679df974e4da793c52f2fb2831eac.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137225/26400" target="_top" id="2137225">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137225" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137225/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> The game is less attractive in VR, with muddier textures and blurrier skybox, but the trade-off for added immersion is well worth the sacrifice. Actually moving your head to scan around the glass cockpit for enemy fighters and capital ships (or your own wingmates) and then diving in to engage is some of the most fun you can have in VR.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130532/26400" target="_top" id="2130532">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130532" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130532/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Authentic-Star-Wars"><a href="#Audio-Authentic-Star-Wars" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Authentic Star Wars"></a><strong>Audio: Authentic Star Wars</strong></h2><p> With the vast majority of video games, your experience is almost as dependent on what you hear as what you see. In this regard, Squadrons is a masterpiece. This game perfectly replicates the epic feel of classic Star Wars space combat from the laser fire, to the roar of your engines, to the exhilarating whoosh of grazing an asteroid. There’s also the unforgettable John Williams soundtrack, which is fully present here and is just as vital to the experience of the game as it is to the films.</p><h2 id="Performance-Solid-on-moderately-powerful-PCs"><a href="#Performance-Solid-on-moderately-powerful-PCs" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Solid on moderately powerful PCs"></a><strong>Performance: Solid on moderately powerful PCs</strong></h2><p> I was able to get consistently high frame rates during gameplay with my custom gaming PC running 32 GB of DDR4 RAM, an AMD Ryzen 7 2700X processor, and an Nvidia RTX 2070 GPU. However, I experienced some odd stuttering in the hanger between missions, which seemed more of a graphical bug than an issue with the power of my PC. I also played Squadrons on a laptop with a less powerful processor, 16GB of RAM, and a Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q. The game performed well and provided a smooth gameplay experience at maximum graphical settings.</p><p> Dogfights are fast, brutal, and thanks to a wide variation in map design, each match feels remarkably fresh and non-repetitive.</p><h2 id="Controls-Wide-support-for-different-inputs"><a href="#Controls-Wide-support-for-different-inputs" class="headerlink" title="Controls: Wide support for different inputs"></a><strong>Controls: Wide support for different inputs</strong></h2><p> Squadrons offers customizable support for a wide range of different control schemes, from gamepads to HOTAS flight sticks to mouse and keyboard. I had to fiddle with a few settings to get my stick and thrust control up and running, but when I did, it added an extra layer of immersion to the experience. However, mouse and keyboard is clearly the optimal and intended control method for Squadrons.</p><h2 id="Multiplayer-Challenging-dogfights"><a href="#Multiplayer-Challenging-dogfights" class="headerlink" title="Multiplayer: Challenging dogfights"></a><strong>Multiplayer: Challenging dogfights</strong></h2><p> Squadrons features a basic but robust multiplayer mode, the bread and butter of which are team-based dogfights. These are exciting and challenging matches that truly test your skill at the game, and thanks to a decent selection of varied maps it really doesn’t get old.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oKG6kRHcFEOz3O6bwL5_SyeUiEM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-4-78947bfe57874d45ae8f401482c3ddf6-379a507c078e44d6898e28d20f53aac9.jpeg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> The other mode features massive large scale multi-stage fleet battles, which require careful team coordination to advance across the battlefield and destroy the enemies’ flagship. It’s a good idea to save this for after you’ve played through most of the campaign, learned the controls, and have tried your hand at a few multiplayer dogfights.</p><h2 id="Price-Good-value"><a href="#Price-Good-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: Good value"></a><strong>Price: Good value</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of just $40 Star Wars: Squadrons is a surprisingly reasonably priced game that bucks the trend of modern AAA games uniformly releasing for $60 regardless of what content they are able to offer. It’s not the longest game, and there is a limit to end-game multiplayer content, so $40 is pretty much the exact right price for Squadrons. It’s refreshing to see a distinct lack of any extra monetization in the game, with no annoying microtransactions or loot boxes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135373/19272" target="_top" id="2135373">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135373" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135373/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Star-Wars-Squadrons-vs-Elite-Dangerous"><a href="#Star-Wars-Squadrons-vs-Elite-Dangerous" class="headerlink" title="Star Wars: Squadrons vs. Elite Dangerous"></a><strong>Star Wars: Squadrons vs. Elite Dangerous</strong></h2><p> If you’re looking for a deeper, more daunting, complex space sim, Elite Dangerous is the next step. Squadrons is far more exciting, being laser-focused on intense aerial combat. Elite Dangerous is a more methodical game, with a focus on exploration and trading, though there’s also exciting combat there if you want it.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> An exhilarating space combat experience that is particularly well suited to VR.</p><p> Star Wars: Squadrons is a fine successor to classic space combat games, and is an undeniably exciting and realistic experience. It’s best if played with a VR headset, but is worth your time and money on a traditional screen as well. The memory of my first flight at the helm of a TIE Fighter in this game has stuck with me with surprising clarity in a way that few moments in video games do, and it’s something you really have to experience for yourself to understand.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Star Wars: Squadrons</li><li>Price  $40.00</li><li>Release Date  October 2020</li><li>Rating  Teen</li><li>Platform  PC, PS4, Xbox One</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-immediate-insta-photo-series-viewing/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Immediate Insta Photo Series Viewing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-e-lecture-documentation/"><u>[New] In 2024, E-Lecture Documentation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-exclusive-list-11-pioneering-cost-free-online-title-makers-for-yt/"><u>[New] In 2024, Exclusive List 11 Pioneering, Cost-Free Online Title Makers for YT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-optimize-social-vids-for-maximum-view-size/"><u>[New] In 2024, Optimize Social Vids for Maximum View Size</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-pixelpilots-pathway-navigating-screen-recorder-landscapes/"><u>[New] In 2024, PixelPilot's Pathway Navigating Screen Recorder Landscapes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-seamless-transition-from-smartphones-to-pc-and-mac-videos/"><u>[New] In 2024, Seamless Transition From Smartphones to PC & Mac Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-virtual-venue-verdict-which-streamer-prevails/"><u>[New] Virtual Venue Verdict Which Streamer Prevails?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-masterclass-constructing-mc-village-houses/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Masterclass Constructing MC Village Houses</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-seamless-strategies-to-record-and-archive-gotomeetings/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Seamless Strategies to Record and Archive GoToMeetings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-boost-sound-level-for-twitters-quiet-vids/"><u>[Updated] Boost Sound Level for Twitter's Quiet Vids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-discovering-an-original-tiktok-identifier-code/"><u>[Updated] Discovering an Original TikTok Identifier Code</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-tech-tips-for-free-tv-show-recording-on-windows/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Tech Tips for Free TV Show Recording on Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-top-ranked-mac-gif-converter/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Top-Ranked Mac GIF Converter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-tutoring-triumph-selecting-the-superior-video-recorder-list/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Tutoring Triumph Selecting the Superior Video Recorder List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-innovative-iphone-and-ipad-video-players-the-10-best-options/"><u>[Updated] Innovative iPhone & iPad Video Players The 10 Best Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-spectacular-top-ten-nintendo-switch-fighter-games-max-156-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Spectacular Top Ten Nintendo Switch Fighter Games (Max 156) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-windowsmac-tutorials-for-skype-audio-and-video-archive-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Windows/Mac Tutorials for Skype Audio & Video Archive for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/how-to-prepare-your-tv-and-audio-systems-for-an-unforgettable-super-bowl-experience-at-home/"><u>How to Prepare Your TV and Audio Systems for an Unforgettable Super Bowl Experience at Home</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/what-are-location-permissions-life360-on-apple-iphone-13-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>What are Location Permissions Life360 On Apple iPhone 13? | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

These activities include:</p><ul><li>Ore mining</li><li>Growing of crops</li><li>Raising some livestock</li><li>Selling of produce, and;</li><li>Crafting of goods</li></ul><p>More so, your character will get to socialize with the people in the town, proceed to marry, and even have kids. Note that roughly three other players can play this game together online. In other news, Stardew Valley has been regarded over time as a masterpiece. It is filled with a relaxing vibe, romance, and, of course, adventure.</p><p>For those interested, the game begins with you, a box of parsnip seeds, and some handy tools.

These activities include:</p><ul><li>Ore mining</li><li>Growing of crops</li><li>Raising some livestock</li><li>Selling of produce, and;</li><li>Crafting of goods</li></ul><p>More so, your character will get to socialize with the people in the town, proceed to marry, and even have kids.

For those who are just starting with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, things may get quite awkward.

To proceed to Stardew Valley Ginger Island, you will need to restore the community center. Note that this particular task will get players closer to being capable of visiting Ginger Island. However, to restore the community center, you will need to create bundles for no one else but the Junimos. The Junimos are found living inside the community center.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Building-a-Broadcast-Brand-with-YouTube-Twitch-and-OBS"><a href="#Building-a-Broadcast-Brand-with-YouTube-Twitch-and-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Building a Broadcast Brand with YouTube, Twitch and OBS"></a>Building a Broadcast Brand with YouTube, Twitch and OBS</h2><h2 id="Part-1-Introduction"><a href="#Part-1-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Introduction"></a>Part 1: Introduction</h2><p>If you want to enhance your audience reach, consider multi-streaming to Twitch and your other preferred sites. Mainstreaming enables you to broadcast on Twitch and YouTube or stream on Twitch and Facebook, or all three! At the same time, with everyone spending more time indoors amid the global crisis, it appears we’re all seeking a diversion and many gamers are asking themselves how to broadcast on YouTube or Twitch. One of the easiest methods to broadcast on Twitch and YouTube Gaming at the same time is via OBS. Streamers may broadcast to more than 30 streaming platforms concurrently using an easy-to-understand user interface. The service is created in a manner that won’t place any demand on your PC hardware or the bandwidth you have available.</p><p>Well, it all boils down to choosing. But if you want to know the streaming networks with the highest traffic, those platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming. Twitch is a mainstreaming service that enables you to broadcast on more than 30 of your favorite platforms simultaneously. It merely takes a few minutes to join your numerous live streaming accounts and interact directly with the popular encoding program OBS. You may also multi streams on Twitch and your other favorite streaming services. Knowing what the correct gear is when you’re starting as a streamer may be intimidating, but we come with good news. Nowadays the entry-level for streaming has reduced quite a bit owing to hardware becoming more affordable, but also because many PCs are already prepared to manage a broadcast or can be readily updated to support one.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Stream-to-Twitch-with-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-Stream-to-Twitch-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Stream to Twitch with OBS"></a>Part 2: Stream to Twitch with OBS</h2><p>If you want to obtain the very greatest quality broadcast, you’re searching for some fantastic software. In the case of Windows, one of the most common solutions is Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) (OBS). Many people are first drawn to OBS since it’s free to use owing to being open source. Luckily, it’s also a feature-rich piece of software that can handle practically anything you throw at it. If you’re new to OBS or to streaming in general, it might be a bit frightening at first.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Getting-a-Stream-Key-from-Twitch"><a href="#Step-1-Getting-a-Stream-Key-from-Twitch" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Getting a Stream Key from Twitch"></a>Step 1. Getting a Stream Key from Twitch</h3><p>Before you stream anything anyplace, you need to provide OBS with the credentials to broadcast on your channel. Exactly how you do this on the large number of services OBS supports may differ, but I’m covering Twitch for this instruction.</p><p>In all circumstances, you need to either produce a stream key in your account settings on the appropriate provider or link your account to OBS if it’s supported like it is on Twitch. Simply signing in with your credentials is by far the simplest approach, and OBS utilizes streaming, so you’re not providing any of your personal login information directly to it. YouTube likewise offers a similar kind of authentication.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitch.jpg"                      alt="twitch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148639/16836" target="_top" id="2148639">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148639" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148639/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-2-Installing-and-Setting-OBS"><a href="#Step-2-Installing-and-Setting-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Step 2. Installing and Setting OBS"></a>Step 2. Installing and Setting OBS</h3><p>OBS Studio is available for all main operating systems such as Windows, Mac OS, and, Linux. You may get the utility by clicking here. Run and install the software to get started. When you launch the program for the first time, OBS Studio performs an Auto-Configuration Wizard. It provides you the choice of selecting between ‘Optimize for streaming’ and ‘Optimize for recording’. Click on the ‘Optimize for streaming’ if you wish to live broadcast your game. The wizard will next examine your system’s performance. It examines and helps adjust your system resolution, bitrate, encoder, and internet connection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/installing-and-setting-obs.jpg"                      alt="installing and setting obs"                ></p><h3 id="Step-3-Configuring-OBS-Studio-for-Streaming-to-Twitch"><a href="#Step-3-Configuring-OBS-Studio-for-Streaming-to-Twitch" class="headerlink" title="Step 3. Configuring OBS Studio for Streaming to Twitch"></a>Step 3. Configuring OBS Studio for Streaming to Twitch</h3><p>Now that you’re set up to the stream, the first step is to select your resolution, frame rate, and bitrate. The greater each of them, the more bandwidth and horsepower you’ll require from your PC. If you’ve got a high-speed internet connection and a strong PC, then you can probably stream at 1080p60 at a high bitrate. But you also need to balance this with offering a stream that’s not going to buffer like wild for your viewers who could be on poorer connections. Remember, if you’re not a partner on Twitch, you won’t have transcoding, thus the experience might be awful for viewers with sluggish connections.</p><p>Once you’re done setting up OBS, you can dig into the advanced capabilities such as OBS sceneries. These will allow you to dramatically boost your live stream production value. If you arrange your OBS scenes and sources appropriately, your broadcast may go from an ordinary-looking stream to one that appears slick and professional.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/configuring-obs-studio.jpg"                      alt="configuring obs studio"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148637/16836" target="_top" id="2148637">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148637" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148637/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-4-Adding-Scene-and-Sources"><a href="#Step-4-Adding-Scene-and-Sources" class="headerlink" title="Step 4. Adding Scene and Sources"></a>Step 4. Adding Scene and Sources</h3><p>A scene may be simply added in OBS by clicking on the addition symbol indicated in the picture below. Once you have chosen this, you will simply be prompted to pick a name for the scene. All of your overlays, sources, and basic on-screen items will need to be introduced through a specified scene. Once you have created your scene and titled it, make sure it is chosen and proceed to the box on the right side of the picture below to click the plus symbol. This brings up the many sources you may pick from for your freshly constructed scenario. The good thing is, once you have inserted a source in one scene, you can simply use it again in another.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adding-scene-and-sources.jpg"                      alt="adding scene and sources"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037475/7443" target="_top" id="2037475">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037475" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037475/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-5-Adding-a-Twitch-Chat"><a href="#Step-5-Adding-a-Twitch-Chat" class="headerlink" title="Step 5. Adding a Twitch Chat"></a>Step 5. Adding a Twitch Chat</h3><p>Adding your twitch chat to your broadcasts may help make your viewers feel more included by enabling them to see their message live on the screen. You may add your Twitch chat box to your live broadcast in OBS by utilizing the browser source. The best practice when employing a chat box is to make sure to have your visuals, displays, and overlays set up to accommodate it. Get the widget URL from your favorite provider and copy it to your clipboard. This is what you will be adding to your OBS sources to add the chat to your overlay. If you’re using Twitch, this will be provided to you once you pick your basic settings for your chat style and layout. In the “Sources” section of OBS, go to the “+” in the bottom left corner, and pick, “Browser” to create a new browser source window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitch-chat.jpg"                      alt="twitch chat"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528703/16446" target="_top" id="1528703">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528703" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528703/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Stream-to-YouTube-with-OBS"><a href="#Part-3-Stream-to-YouTube-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Stream to YouTube with OBS"></a>Part 3: Stream to YouTube with OBS</h2><p>You may get it by browsing OBS Studio’s official website. If you’re using Windows 11, you shouldn’t be concerned about compatibility, since OBS is completely tuned to function with it. You may also broadcast game videos on YouTube. YouTube Gaming is a service devoted to gaming content providers and their viewers. Similar to Twitch and Facebook Gaming, it’s YouTube’s area for the gaming community.

Webcams are commonly used during screen recording sessions, to capture the footage of the narrator, but a simple mistake like, not paying attention to the video’s background can ruin a perfectly captured webcam video.</p><p>Besides removing the messy backgrounds, you can also add templates or custom made backgrounds to webcam videos if you would like to hide private information, put the accent on the narrator of the video or improve its overall quality. In this guide, we are going to show you how to replace or remove the background while you are recording webcam videos with Logitech webcam.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Record PC screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h2 id="How-to-replace-and-remove-the-background-with-Personify-ChromaCam-software"><a href="#How-to-replace-and-remove-the-background-with-Personify-ChromaCam-software" class="headerlink" title="How to replace and remove the background with Personify ChromaCam software"></a>How to replace and remove the background with <a class="link"   href="https://www.chromacam.me/" >Personify ChromaCam software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037335/7443" target="_top" id="2037335">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037335" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037335/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="ChromaCam-for-Logitech-Webcam"><a href="#ChromaCam-for-Logitech-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="ChromaCam for Logitech Webcam"></a>ChromaCam for Logitech Webcam</h3><p>Before you can start customizing the backgrounds of your webcam videos, there are a few preparation steps you have to take. Currently, Personify ChromaCam is available <strong>only on the Windows operating system,</strong> so Mac users can’t install the software even if they own a Logitech C992 Pro Stream webcam and BRIO 4K Pro Webcam. If you purchased these webcam models, you will be asked if you want to install the Personify ChromaCam software for free when you connect the webcam to a computer for the first time.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> You can download the software from the ChromaCam<a class="link"   href="https://www.chromacam.me/download/" >website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you are not using the Logitech C922 or BRIO 4K webcam. ChromaCam works with all 2D webcams, but you may need to pay.</p><p>The software’s tech specs are not demanding, but you’ll still need to have <strong>at least Windows 7,</strong> or a more recent version of the Windows OS installed on your PC as well as an Intel or AMD Processor and <strong>4GB of RAM memory.</strong> ChromaCam is <strong>optimized for 64-bit Windows,</strong> although it can work on 32-bit version of the OS, and the software can only be used with processors included in the Intel AVX Set. Personify ChromaCam is compatible with a lot of video chatting apps and broadcasting software products, including Skype, OBS Studio, <a class="link"   href="https://www.xsplit.com/" >XSplit Broadcaster software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (we will take it for example in this article) , Google Hangouts, GameShow or Twitch, to mention a few.</p><p>Regardless of the software, you’re using with ChromaCam, the setup process is fairly simple and it includes only a few easy steps. We are going to show how you can replace and remove backgrounds with Personify ChromaCam using the <a class="link"   href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/c922-pro-stream-webcam" >Logitech C922 Pro Stream <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> webcam.</p><h4 id="Step-1-–-Download-Install-ChromaCam-software"><a href="#Step-1-–-Download-Install-ChromaCam-software" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 – Download &amp; Install ChromaCam software"></a>Step 1 – Download &amp; Install ChromaCam software</h4><p>Connect the webcam to your PC, and install the ChromaCam software. If for some reason your Logitech C922 Pro Stream webcam doesn’t provide this option, you can download the software from the<a class="link"   href="http://support.logitech.com/en%5Fus/downloads" >Logitech’s customer support page. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logitech-c922-chromacam.jpg"                      alt="logitech-c922-chromacam "                ></p><p>Personify ChromaCam works as an add-on for screencasting and broadcasting software products, that allows you to select a new background for the webcam video. The background removal and replacement features the ChromaCam offers enable users to combine several sources of videos while broadcasting live on the Internet’s most popular video streaming platforms.</p><p>The free version of ChromaCam adds watermarks to all videos, and you must pay a $29,99 one-time fee to remove them. However, the free version of the software that comes bundled with Logitech C922 Pro Stream webcam doesn’t create watermarks.</p><p>When the ChromaCam software is successfully installed on your PC, and after you’ve made sure that the webcam is working properly, you can launch the XSplit Broadcaster. If you haven’t installed this software on your PC yet, you can click <a class="link"   href="https://www.chromacam.me/#about" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to start the installation process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/personify-chromacam-remove-background.jpg"                      alt="personify-chromacam-remove-background "                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Setting-up-a-new-recording-session"><a href="#Step-2-Setting-up-a-new-recording-session" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 - Setting up a new recording session"></a>Step 2 - Setting up a new recording session</h4><p>Once the XSplit software opens, you should head to the <strong>Add Source</strong> menu, and then select the Personify ChormaCam from the Webcam, capture card, video devices drop-down list. The Personify window will pop-up on the screen, and you’ll be able to select a new background for the webcam video by clicking on the templates featured in the Personify window.</p><p>If you’d like to adjust the video recording settings, you should right-click on the C922 Pro Stream webcam and open the Configure drop-down menu. Select the Video Output feature, and proceed to pick the Color Space Compression, Frame Rato or the Output size. The Video Input option in the Configure menu, grants you access to Logitech’s Camera Settings for the webcam and enables you to activate the Low Light Compensation feature, that improves the C922 Pro Stream’s performance in low-light conditions.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Selecting-the-background-removal-and-replacement-options"><a href="#Step-3-Selecting-the-background-removal-and-replacement-options" class="headerlink" title="Step 3 - Selecting the background removal and replacement options"></a>Step 3 - Selecting the background removal and replacement options</h4><p>In the ChromaCam window, you can select a transparent background option if you would like to blend the figure into the screen recording or some of the template backgrounds that make the narrator stand out against the background. The software allows you to import custom made backgrounds by clicking on the plus icon in the Personify ChromaCam window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromacam-interface.jpg"                      alt="chromacam-interface "                ></p><p>Making sure that the figure in the webcam video is properly cropped is the most important part of the process because badly cropped videos reveal too much of the previous background. The software’s cropping precision is limited, although the Personify ChromaCam provides tools that make the figure’s edges smoother.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Recording-with-ChromaCam"><a href="#Step-4-Recording-with-ChromaCam" class="headerlink" title="Step 4 - Recording with ChromaCam"></a>Step 4 - Recording with ChromaCam</h4><p>Before you start a new broadcast or a screen recording by clicking on their icons on the XSplit’s top bar, make sure that you are properly positioned and that the webcam is directed towards you. The Personify ChromaCam focuses on the head and torso of the figure in the video, so try not to move too much. The new background cuts out the parts of the figure that go out into the area of the background that has been replaced or removed, which can produce an awkward visual effect</p><p>You can pause or stop recording with a single click and all you’ll be able to find your videos in the XSplit’s Recordings tab.</p><p>You can also use this software in other screen recording software, please share with us how it works for you in the comment below.</p><h2 id="Tips-for-better-background-replacement"><a href="#Tips-for-better-background-replacement" class="headerlink" title="Tips for better background replacement"></a>Tips for better background replacement</h2><p>Changing or removing the background in a webcam video is easy, but there a few things you can do to ensure that all webcam videos created with Personify ChromaCam software meet the highest visual standards.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043855/7443" target="_top" id="2043855">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043855" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043855/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Use-simple-monochrome-backgrounds"><a href="#1-Use-simple-monochrome-backgrounds" class="headerlink" title="1.

Use simple monochrome backgrounds</h3><p>Complex backgrounds that contain a lot of details should be avoided at all cost because the software won’t know which part of the screen you want to replace. A minimalistic, clean working background that doesn’t contain anything that might distract the viewer or the software, will make it easier for the software to place an outline around the figure and separate it from the rest of the image.</p><h3 id="2-Find-the-right-balance-between-the-performance-and-video-quality"><a href="#2-Find-the-right-balance-between-the-performance-and-video-quality" class="headerlink" title="2.

Find the right balance between the performance and video quality</h3><p>Logitech C922 can capture videos at 60 fps in 720p resolution when used with Personify ChromaCam, but the software also enables you to reduce the screen recording quality you’re producing and increase the quality of the webcam footage. Click on the Setting icon in the Personify window and then just drag the Performance VS Quality slider to improve the quality of the footage produced by ChromaCam. However, lowering the video quality will also decrease the frame rate, so your screen recordings may not be as smooth as they would be if they were captured at the maximum resolution.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135413/19272" target="_top" id="2135413">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135413" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135413/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Use-professional-lighting-equipment"><a href="#3-Use-professional-lighting-equipment" class="headerlink" title="3.

Webcam videos captured under low-light conditions are often blurry and the person featured in the video is hard to recognize. That’s the reason why you should always strive to have a sufficient amount of light in the webcam video, so the ChromaCam software can easily place an outline around the figure in the video. Using more than one spotlight to light the scene can help you remove the shadows cast by a Persona in the video because shadows can make the background removal software less efficient.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137379/7443" target="_top" id="2137379">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137379" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137379/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-elite-scripting-developing-a-countdown-mechanism-in-obs/"><u>[New] Elite Scripting Developing a Countdown Mechanism in OBS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-evaluating-the-superiority-of-splitcams-recording/"><u>[Updated] Evaluating the Superiority of SplitCam's Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-free-screen-recording-techniques-for-pc-enthusiasts/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Free Screen Recording Techniques for PC Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/enhancing-gaming-the-ultimate-xbox-screen-recorders-guide-for-2024/"><u>Enhancing Gaming The Ultimate Xbox Screen Recorder's Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/from-still-images-to-time-lapses-ipad-edition-for-2024/"><u>From Still Images to Time-Lapses IPad Edition for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-7-ways-to-unlock-a-locked-oneplus-ace-2-pro-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, 7 Ways to Unlock a Locked OnePlus Ace 2 Pro Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-expert-advice-enhancing-your-screen-capture-game-with-mobizen-tools/"><u>In 2024, Expert Advice Enhancing Your Screen Capture Game with Mobizen Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-perfect-your-images-with-dynamic-text-tools/"><u>In 2024, Perfect Your Images with Dynamic Text Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://program-issues.techidaily.com/solving-the-halo-infinite-audio-glitch-no-more-stutters/"><u>Solving the Halo Infinite Audio Glitch: No More Stutters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/streamline-client-onboarding-process-for-enhanced-brand-loyalty-in-finance/"><u>Streamline Client Onboarding Process for Enhanced Brand Loyalty in Finance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/your-picks-for-the-best-photovideo-makers-that-tune-in-music-for-2024/"><u>Your Picks for the Best Photo/Video Makers That Tune in Music for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Thus, popular video-conferencing platforms allow users to add filters, effects, and masks, and Google meet is no different. So, you can adorn your video call with these fun features no matter you are using an Android or iOS device. Google Meet features a vast collection of filters and masks that you can use to hide your face. Plus, you can also use these features to give the video session an entertaining touch. In the following article, we will guide how to add these features to Google Meet.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Requirement of Using Filters and Effects on Google Meet</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Add Filters, Effects, or Masks on Google Meet?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Remove Applied Filters, Effects, or Masks on Google Meet?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Best Filters and Visual Effects Chrome Extensions for Google Meet</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-Requirement-of-Using-Filters-and-Effects-on-Google-Meet"><a href="#Part-1-Requirement-of-Using-Filters-and-Effects-on-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Requirement of Using Filters and Effects on Google Meet"></a>Part 1: Requirement of Using Filters and Effects on Google Meet</h2><p>Filters and effects are an exciting and useful feature offered by Google Meet to its users. However, Google Meet does not allow all accounts to use filters and mask in the same way. To cut the story short, some of the masks and filters might be accessible with workspace, while others are only usable through your personal Gmail accounts. Workplace place accounts need to be professional with limited filters and effects available for them. If you want to know the requirements for using filters and effects on specific devices and different accounts, the following section will discuss them in detail.</p><ul><li><strong>Account</strong></li></ul><p>Using your personal account rather than the workplace account is better to use maximum filters, effects, and masks. Duo-style filters, AR masks, to name a few, are features that can be easily applied when using Google Meet through personal accounts.</p><ul><li><strong>Operating system</strong></li></ul><p>Some visual filters and masks are only to be enjoyed when you join video sessions through Android and iOS apps. This means you may not be able to access them through internet browsers.</p><ul><li><strong>Participation in a video call</strong></li></ul><p>To use filters and effects, you must be a participant in the Google Meet session. So, you must log in preferably through your personal Gmail account to enjoy unlimited filters, effects, and masks.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-Filters-Effects-or-Masks-on-Google-Meet"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-Filters-Effects-or-Masks-on-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add Filters, Effects, or Masks on Google Meet?"></a>Part 2: How to Add Filters, Effects, or Masks on Google Meet?</h2><p>Google Meet lets you add filters, effects, and masks to make a video call a fun-filled activity. Effects fall in a broader domain. In short, there exist few different categories in effects, including filters, styles, background, and masks. Plus, they are also completely different. Effects are used to enhance the video by adding unique transitions such as fading and other visual effects. On the other hand, filters improve your look by adding different frames and designs in a video. Last but not least, masks add funky faces and covers to your face.</p><p>Are you interested in mastering the art of adding filters, effects, and masks?

In-depth Review"></a>3. In-depth Review</h2><p>Let us move on to the detailed SplitCam review and analyze how it performs on the parameters that matter the most.</p><p>Performance: SplitCam is not as heavy an application as some of the professional video recorders. Hence, it does not put much pressure on CPU resource. Since the video recording quality is restricted, even at the highest resolution, performance is smooth.</p><p>Video Quality: The video quality is restricted to maximum of 2048x1536 resolution. Therefore, you cannot shoot 4K videos even though your webcam or desktop screen has 4K resolution. Hence, there is a scope for improvement in video quality which is why users look for other SplitCam similar software.</p><p>Support Devices: You can record your external webcam, desktop screen, as well as IP camera. Besides, it supports NDI devices. However, the software is only available for Windows 7 and Windows 10.</p><p>Editing Options: There are different customization options available for adjusting video parameters such as brightness, saturation, and even skin smoother. However, it lacks editing options post-recording so that you could take the video to the next level.</p><h2 id="4-Best-Alternative"><a href="#4-Best-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="4.
