The process of converting a PPT file into a video file in PowerPoint 2007 may not be as simple as on the latest version of the software, but it is far from being complicated. Please note that if you have a 2013 PowerPoint and you want to save a PPT file created on the 2007 version of the software you can do so by clicking on the Create a Video option. Here’s how you can convert a PowerPoint presentation to video if you are still using PowerPoint 2007.</p><p>Before you proceed any further you’ll have to make sure that you have <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Windows Movie Maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> installed on your PC.

Thus, popular video-conferencing platforms allow users to add filters, effects, and masks, and Google meet is no different. So, you can adorn your video call with these fun features no matter you are using an Android or iOS device. Google Meet features a vast collection of filters and masks that you can use to hide your face. Plus, you can also use these features to give the video session an entertaining touch. In the following article, we will guide how to add these features to Google Meet.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Requirement of Using Filters and Effects on Google Meet</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Add Filters, Effects, or Masks on Google Meet?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Remove Applied Filters, Effects, or Masks on Google Meet?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Best Filters and Visual Effects Chrome Extensions for Google Meet</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-Requirement-of-Using-Filters-and-Effects-on-Google-Meet"><a href="#Part-1-Requirement-of-Using-Filters-and-Effects-on-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Requirement of Using Filters and Effects on Google Meet"></a>Part 1: Requirement of Using Filters and Effects on Google Meet</h2><p>Filters and effects are an exciting and useful feature offered by Google Meet to its users. However, Google Meet does not allow all accounts to use filters and mask in the same way. To cut the story short, some of the masks and filters might be accessible with workspace, while others are only usable through your personal Gmail accounts. Workplace place accounts need to be professional with limited filters and effects available for them. If you want to know the requirements for using filters and effects on specific devices and different accounts, the following section will discuss them in detail.</p><ul><li><strong>Account</strong></li></ul><p>Using your personal account rather than the workplace account is better to use maximum filters, effects, and masks. Duo-style filters, AR masks, to name a few, are features that can be easily applied when using Google Meet through personal accounts.</p><ul><li><strong>Operating system</strong></li></ul><p>Some visual filters and masks are only to be enjoyed when you join video sessions through Android and iOS apps. This means you may not be able to access them through internet browsers.</p><ul><li><strong>Participation in a video call</strong></li></ul><p>To use filters and effects, you must be a participant in the Google Meet session. So, you must log in preferably through your personal Gmail account to enjoy unlimited filters, effects, and masks.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-Filters-Effects-or-Masks-on-Google-Meet"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-Filters-Effects-or-Masks-on-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add Filters, Effects, or Masks on Google Meet?"></a>Part 2: How to Add Filters, Effects, or Masks on Google Meet?</h2><p>Google Meet lets you add filters, effects, and masks to make a video call a fun-filled activity. Effects fall in a broader domain. In short, there exist few different categories in effects, including filters, styles, background, and masks. Plus, they are also completely different. Effects are used to enhance the video by adding unique transitions such as fading and other visual effects. On the other hand, filters improve your look by adding different frames and designs in a video. Last but not least, masks add funky faces and covers to your face.</p><p>Are you interested in mastering the art of adding filters, effects, and masks? If yes, let’s have a look at the step-by-step guide below.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Launch the application and join the meeting</strong></p><p>Click on Google Meet’s application on your iOS or Android device. Select <strong>join meeting</strong> or <strong>join with a code</strong> to join video session.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Apply effects</strong></p><p>Tap on the <strong>sparkle icon</strong> at the bottom of your video.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Choose filters or masks</strong></p><p>Swipe till you find filters. Select <strong>filters</strong> and choose the mask you want to apply.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Remove-Applied-Filters-Effects-or-Masks-on-Google-Meet"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Remove-Applied-Filters-Effects-or-Masks-on-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Remove Applied Filters, Effects, or Masks on Google Meet?"></a>Part 3: How to Remove Applied Filters, Effects, or Masks on Google Meet?</h2><p>In Google Meet, the applied effects, filters, or masks are not permanent. So, you can remove it at any time during the video meeting. Plus, if you get bored with specific masks or filters, you may also replace them with another one.

Due to the hybrid nature of Switch, it offers much greater flexibility while gaming on the go. Nintendo Switch is a noteworthy gaming console since it is portable, in contrast to Xbox and Sony.</p><p>You can play the Switch directly on the TV, or you can connect it to your smart TV for playing on the big screen. In comparison to other gaming consoles, Switch has a competitive edge because it is portable and dockable. Each month, a new Switch game is released, keeping you occupied with various gaming genres.</p><p>Below we have compiled a list of some best Nintendo Switch Fighting Games. Choose a game based on your preferences and enjoy it.</p><h3 id="1-Street-Fighter-30th-Anniversary-Collection"><a href="#1-Street-Fighter-30th-Anniversary-Collection" class="headerlink" title="1.Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection"></a>1.Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/street-fighter-30th-anniversary-collection-poster.jpg"                      alt="street-fighter-30th-anniversary-collection-poster"                ></p><p>There are many Street Fighters in this collection; apart from Street Fighter IV and Street Fighter V, it contains nearly every core entry in the franchise. It’s nearly impossible to dispute the sheer quantity and quality of gameplay options within the 30th Anniversary Collection, which include fighters that helped shape the genre, such as Street Fighter II Turbo and arguably the greatest fighting games of all time, such as Street Fighter III: Third Strike.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Street Fighter classics ported to the arcade</p><p>• Fans will find a variety of bonus materials</p><p>• A great choice for competitive play</p><h3 id="2-Super-Smash-Bros-Ultimate"><a href="#2-Super-Smash-Bros-Ultimate" class="headerlink" title="2.Super Smash Bros.

Ultimate</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/super-smash-bros-ultimate-poster.jpg"                      alt="super-smash-bros-ultimate-poster"                ></p><p>Super Smash Bros. was released in 2018. Featuring over 80 playable characters, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is the latest entry in the series and the largest crossover yet. It may have been polarizing to some Smash fans, causing them to stick with Melee, but Smash Ultimate has both a gargantuan amount of content and a finely tuned platform fighter gameplay that makes it appealing to both casual and competitive players alike.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• This is an excellent party game</p><p>• Kirby fans’ version of Super Smash Bros</p><p>• Easy to learn and play</p><p>• Simple yet attractive gameplay</p><h3 id="3-Dragonball-FighterZ"><a href="#3-Dragonball-FighterZ" class="headerlink" title="3.Dragonball FighterZ"></a>3.Dragonball FighterZ</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dragonball-fighterz-poster.jpg"                      alt="dragonball-fighterz-poster"                ></p><p>As a result of the anime show’s popularity, Nintendo has known that new fans might try out fighting games for the first time as a result. While this Dragon Ball title might be a good introduction to the genre, veterans can also enjoy it. As in the comics and on-screen side of this universe, this title’s visual style perfectly fits the fans’ expectations. This game has recognizable moves, an extensive roster of warriors, and a pace that matches the speed these lethal soldiers should possess in battle.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Bringing Dragon Ball Z mayhem to life</p><p>• The visuals are stunning</p><p>• It’s fast and fun to play tag team</p><p>• Overall a great game to enjoy</p><h3 id="4-King-Of-Fighters-‘98"><a href="#4-King-Of-Fighters-‘98" class="headerlink" title="4.King Of Fighters ‘98"></a>4.King Of Fighters ‘98</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/king-of-fighters-98-poster.jpg"                      alt="king-of-fighters-98-poster"                ></p><p>King of Fighters is a fighting game franchise developed by a legendary game developer, SNK, with more than fifteen entries spanning nearly thirty years. Nearly every King of Fighters entry is currently available as a footsies-focused fighter that lets players create teams of characters. A notable exception is King of Fighters ‘98, which many have praised as the best entry in the series because it is incredibly polished and refined.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• A lot of versatile characters available to choose from</p><p>• Best action and fighting environment</p><p>• Despite being released more than two decades ago, the game still presents the same level of excitement and thrill</p><h3 id="5-Mortal-Kombat-11"><a href="#5-Mortal-Kombat-11" class="headerlink" title="5.Mortal Kombat 11"></a>5.Mortal Kombat 11</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mortal-kombat-11-poster.jpg"                      alt="mortal-kombat-11-poster"                ></p><p>In recent years, the Mortal Kombat series has grown in stature, and with HBO’s movie reboot coming soon, Mortal Kombat 11 on Nintendo Switch might be a good time to revisit it. The game uses the Switch platform well, even though it is not exclusive to the console.</p><p>The narrative in this game, along with its diverse roster and some of its surprises, has been praised. Even those with the Switch have access to this incredible game. This game may be the measuring stick for every other game in its genre.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• The game presents the best cinematics</p><p>• On Switch, you can play this game at 60 fps</p><p>• The decent character rooster makes it even more interesting</p><p>• It is fun and enjoyable to play the game with each character’s unique abilities</p><h3 id="6-Power-Rangers-Battle-For-The-Grid"><a href="#6-Power-Rangers-Battle-For-The-Grid" class="headerlink" title="6.Power Rangers: Battle For The Grid"></a>6.Power Rangers: Battle For The Grid</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/power-rangers-poster.png"                      alt="power-rangers-poster"                ></p><p>Bringing the two Japanese icons Nintendo &amp; Power Rangers, together is a feat to be celebrated. Fans are praising the game’s range of heroes from the beloved franchise, with its fast-paced gameplay working well on handheld devices.</p><p>Even though the game uses a tag-team mechanic that few others use, its gameplay is just as captivating as the show, despite the occasional shaky sound design.

This is exactly what screen recorders are made for. You may simply record video discussions with family and friends, record streaming videos, record lessons and educational films for business, and record live gameplay to share with gamers and fans with the correct screen recorder.</p><p>Lagging may make a screen recording a pain in the buttocks, as handy as it may seem. Imagine attempting to capture a crucial instruction or a high-intensity video game when the audio starts to lag behind the footage, or the video skips and jumps or stops needlessly. When your computer’s RAM storage is being used up too quickly, it may lag. This is common when you have numerous programs and apps running at the same time that need a lot of RAM. This is where the majority of screen recorders fall. A few paid and free no lag screen recorders have recently entered the market to provide consumers with the greatest lag-free screen recorder option. While various screen recorders fight to be the best of the best, we’ve created a detailed no lag screen recorder comparison table to determine who is the best.</p><h2 id="1-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#1-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1.

It doesn’t need the usage of a third-party app. Use VEED’s webcam recorder to create a video, edit it and save it to your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-veed-mp3-to-text.jpg"                      alt="veed recorder"                ></p><p><strong>How to use it?</strong></p><p>Step 1. Select the video you shot with a green screen backdrop by clicking the ‘Choose Video’ button. You may also drop it into the editor by dragging and dropping it.</p><p>Step 2. Toggle on the ‘Chroma Key’ option after selecting the video on the timeline. Select the green screen using the eyedropper tool. It will vanish, and you may choose another picture to replace it with.</p><p>Step 3. When you’re satisfied with your video modifications, simply click ‘Export’ to have your video downloaded to your smartphone.</p><h3 id="5-Camtasia-3"><a href="#5-Camtasia-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Camtasia"></a>5. Camtasia</h3><p>Camtasia is an easy-to-use video editor and chroma key programme that may meet your basic green screen editing requirements. As a novice with no editing knowledge, this is the ideal video editor for creating quality films, whether you’re an amateur or a professional looking to spruce up your material.</p><p>It’s a multi-purpose video editing programme perfect for beginning editors who are just getting started with green screen video editing. Unless you’re a genuine video editing specialist, using specialised green screen software might be intimidating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camtasia-main-website-interface.jpg"                      alt="camtasia screen recorder"                ></p><p><strong>How to use it?</strong></p><p>Step 1. In Camtasia, go to the visual effects menu and choose the “delete a colour” tool. To complete the process, just drag and drop the clip onto your computer screen. That’s it!</p><p>Step 2. Select the colour from your scene that you wish to delete. This is generally most effective when the colour green or blue is present in your scenario. Green and blue are two of the most often utilised colours to change the backdrop in movies because of their versatility.</p><p>Step 3. Change the picture or backdrop in your scene to the film, background, or image you choose. In Camtasia, you can quickly scale your picture by rotating it in the properties window and utilising the rotation tools to make the image seem more significant.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Attracting the attention of a viewer always necessitates the use of visual elements like a green screen. To stand out in the vast internet market, a videographer does not always have the luxury of filming in the ideal setting. Using software-based simulation, which replaces the actual video backdrop with the required one chroma-keying, is a simple solution to this problem. Remove the video’s backdrop using one of three methods available to you.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"
