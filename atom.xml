If you would like to make sure that your webcam videos are always captured in the best quality possible, then you should consider purchasing an external webcam. However, before you reach the decision which webcam model you want to buy there are a few things you should take into consideration.</p><p>The quality of the video you’ll be able to create depends on the maximum resolution your webcam can produce. If video quality is really important to you, our advice is to acquire a webcam that can create a video in <strong>1280X960P</strong> <strong>resolution</strong> or higher.</p><p><strong>Frame rate</strong> ensures that your videos will always look smooth and that’s the reason why your webcam should produce <strong>at least 25 frames per second</strong>. Furthermore, the sound quality is as important as video quality, which is why you should make sure that your webcam has a built-in microphone capable of capturing clear high-quality sound or you should external microphone is necessary.</p><p>The <strong>connection options</strong> the webcam of your choice offers should play a part in your decision-making process, especially if you intend to create webcam videos from a desktop computer. Features such as <strong>mounting options</strong> or <strong>auto zoom</strong> should also be considered before purchasing a webcam.</p><p>Users in need of a high-quality webcam capable of remarkable performances should try using <a class="link"   href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/4k-pro-webcam" >Logitech 4K pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> webcam designed for video conferencing, video recording or streaming. This Logitech’s model comes equipped with 4K UHD video recording option, built-in mic, background replacement feature and numerous other options that make webcam video recording look simple.</p><p>On the other hand, if you are looking for a more affordable webcam then <a class="link"   href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/webcams/lifecam-hd-3000/t3h-00011" >Microsoft LifeCam HD 3000 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a near perfect choice for you.

Choose the camera angle carefully"></a>1. Choose the camera angle carefully</h4><p>Unlike conventional videos, most webcam videos are recorded from a single camera position. You should place the camera at the straight angle since this type of camera position is frequently used in tutorials, software walkthroughs or gaming videos. However, if you choose a low-angle or a high-angle shot, make sure that the subject of the shot is placed at the very center of the frame.</p><h4 id="2-Make-sure-that-there-is-enough-light-in-the-shot"><a href="#2-Make-sure-that-there-is-enough-light-in-the-shot" class="headerlink" title="2. Make sure that there is enough light in the shot"></a>2. Make sure that there is enough light in the shot</h4><p>The importance of good lighting in a webcam video is often overlooked. Although using professional lighting equipment during a webcam video production may not be necessary, it is still important that a person or objects in the video are properly lit. You can combine atmospheric sources of light with artificial ones such as common lamps or LED spotlights.</p><h4 id="3-Use-an-external-microphone"><a href="#3-Use-an-external-microphone" class="headerlink" title="3.Use an external microphone"></a>3.Use an <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >external microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Most webcams of the latest generation have a built-in microphone, but if you would like to be sure that your voiceover is impeccable, we suggest using an external shotgun microphone. This type of microphone rejects atmospheric noises from 30 degrees on both sides, while perfectly capturing the sounds coming directly from the front.</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Editor-for-Editing-the-Recorded-Webcam-Video"><a href="#Best-Video-Editor-for-Editing-the-Recorded-Webcam-Video" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editor for Editing the Recorded Webcam Video"></a>Best Video Editor for Editing the Recorded Webcam Video</h2><p>Despite being one of the best screen and webcam recorders on the market, the video editing options Filmora Scrn offers still lack the depth of more advanced video editing software products.

The controller has an excellent battery life, very accurate analog sticks, and large buttons more substantial than those on the Switch joy cons. Especially if you’ve been using an Xbox 360 controller for a while and are ready to upgrade, it’s an excellent choice for your next PC controller.</p><p>Utilizing the Nintendo Switch Pro controller for most of your PC games is a breeze thanks to Steam’s controller configurator, which officially supports this controller. Plug-and-play is the most accurate description. To play games, not on Steam, you need to use this guide.</p><p>This article will tell you how to enable your Nintendo Switch Pro controller to work with Steam or Windows, either through a Bluetooth connection or a wired connection. The first thing you’ll need is a Nintendo Switch Pro controller (obviously) and a USB-C cable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/switch-pro-controller-poster.jpg"                      alt="switch-pro-controller-poster"                ></p><hr><p><strong>You might be interested in:</strong></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top Best Nintendo Switch Emulators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Record Nintendo Switch Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Wired-Connection-for-Switch-Pro-Controllers"><a href="#Wired-Connection-for-Switch-Pro-Controllers" class="headerlink" title="Wired Connection for Switch Pro Controllers"></a><strong>Wired Connection for Switch Pro Controllers</strong></h2><p>Windows describe it as a DirectInput controller instead of an XInput controller, so getting it to work with PC games can prove tedious. However, thanks to Value-adding full Switch controller support to Steam, you will probably be able to play most of your favorite games.</p><p><strong>Step1:</strong> Connect the Pro Controller cable (or any USB-A-to-USB-C cable) to your PC. If your computer has a USB-C port, connect the USB-C-to-USB-C data cable instead.</p><p><strong>Step2:</strong> Connect the other end of the cable to your PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/switch-pro-controller-connected-with-cable.jpg"                      alt="switch-pro-controller-connected-with-cable"                ></p><p>There you have it!

It is possible to switch between using the Nintendo Button Layout (clockwise X, A, B, Y from the top) or the Xbox controller button layout (clockwise Y, B, A, X).</p><p>When configured through Steam, you should use the Pro Controller with any Steam game similar to an Xbox gamepad. Vibration can be enabled or disabled by selecting a controller from the “Detected Controllers” list in the same setup screen as before. It is possible to calibrate the analog sticks by clicking the Calibrate button manually. Also, the controller can be set to disconnect after a specified amount of time before going to sleep.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/switch-pro-controller-steam-set-up2.png"                      alt="switch-pro-controller-steam-set-up2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072200/17885" target="_top" id="2072200"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072200"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072200/17885"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Enter the Switch Pro Controller overlay from Steam’s controller options while running in Big Picture mode. There are several ways to map the inputs on the Pro Controller, but default configurations are usually sufficient for most games.

But what if you want to play a non-steam game using a switch pro controller? What will you do now? The switch pro controller hardware support will run out of luck in this scenario.</p><p>The main problem here now is how windows will detect your switch pro controller now if you want to play non-steam games. Luckily there are two simple solutions for this problem.</p><p><strong>Solution1:</strong> The first solution is to use an external Bluetooth adapter that is specifically designed for different types of gamepads.

They look very nice, right. You can also make such game streaming videos by yourself, thanks to Filmora’s latest AI Portrait feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-streaming-poster.jpg"                      alt="game-streaming-poster"                ></p><p>There is a huge competition on Youtube for the game streaming category. If you want to stand out from the crowd and make your mark on viewers’ minds, you have to make videos unique and different from all those streamers. One of the best ways to make your game streaming videos stunning and cool is to remove the background of your footage on the corner.</p><p>If you are going to do it traditionally, you will need so many materials like a green background sheet, a stand to hold that sheet, and more. But with Fimlora’s AI Portrait feature, there is no need to purchase all these things. AI Portrait uses Artificial Intelligence to detect the human in the video and separate it from the background for you, saving you a lot of time and effort. It will help remove the background but you can also add various effects like border, glitches, and more. It will not only make your video stand out but it will also help your cover less area of the videos.</p><hr><p><strong>You might be interested in:</strong></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Make a Reaction Video Quickly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Make Thumbnail For Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Game-Streaming-Video-Step-by-Step"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Game-Streaming-Video-Step-by-Step" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Game Streaming Video [Step by Step]"></a>How to Make a Game Streaming Video [Step by Step]</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/store/secure.png"                      alt="Filmora secure download"                > Secure Download</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/store/secure.png"                      alt="Filmora secure download"                > Secure Download</p><p>Using AI Portrait doesn’t require any kind of technical skills or expertise.

If it is not already installed on your PC, you can download it from <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and install it on your PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step1.png"                      alt="game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 02:</strong> Import your Gameplay and your own video into the Filmora by clicking on the import button or by dragging the media into Filmora.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step2.png"                      alt="game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 03:</strong> Drag both of these footages into the timeline. Make sure to place your self-recording above the gameplay.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step3.png"                      alt="game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 04:</strong> Select your self-recording and click on effects. Go to the AI Portraits. It shows all the AI Portrait effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step4.png"                      alt="game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step4"                ></p><p><strong>Step 05:</strong> Since we want to remove the background of our video, drag the “Human Segmentation” effect into the footage to apply it. You can easily purchase it from here. It will ask you to purchase it if you haven’t purchased it already.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step5.png"                      alt="game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step5"                ></p><p><strong>Step 06:</strong> Once it is applied to the footage, it will separate the background from the character and remove the background.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step6.png"                      alt="game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step6"                ></p><p><strong>Step 07:</strong> Adjust the footage by making it smaller and moving to the lower-left corner of the screen. We are good to go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step7.png"                      alt="game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step7"                ></p><p><strong>Step 08:</strong> If in some part of the video you want to show something covered by the character, you can easily change the character’s position using keyframes for a smooth movement. To make sure the character footage is selected, pause the video when you want to change the position of the character and click on the keyframe button above the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step8.png"                      alt="game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 09:</strong> It will automatically add a keyframe. Now move forward into the timeline, drag the character’s position to your preferred position, and hit OK. It will move the character from the old position to the new position smoothly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step9.png"                      alt="game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step9"                ></p><p><strong>Step 10:</strong> If you want to move the character to the same position, move forward into the timeline and drag it to the same position.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step10.png"                      alt="game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step10"                ></p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>After following and applying all the steps, your game streaming video is ready to be uploaded on Youtube or any other video-sharing platform. This AI Portrait will make your videos unique and distinct from all other videos and help you gain more views and subscribers. Using AI Portrait will not only save your time but money as well. Because removing the background from videos required Green Sheet and other material to place and hold it. Filmora AI Portrait feature helps you get rid of all those unnecessary and difficult to carry and setup materials. Now you can make your game streaming videos anytime and anywhere.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload

Whether it’s an engineer, graphical designer, or programmer, he will prefer Linux-based operating systems and computers. Therefore, Macbook Air computers since 2008 are commonly used by information technology geeks. Nowadays, this trend has not been limited to its professional users but everyone in our circle wants to buy a cool Macbook despite its use.</p><p>Well, in this scenario using the graphical GUI might seem easy but it’s not pretty basic to that of windows. Many of us want to capture our screen either for educational purposes or entertainment but doing that on Macbook might not be so simple. However, you don’t need to panic because we have got you all covered in this article. We will see how to screen record on MacBook Air using different techniques. So let’s begin one by one in the coming sections.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Use-Keyboard-Shortcuts"><a href="#Part-1-Use-Keyboard-Shortcuts" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Use Keyboard Shortcuts"></a>Part 1: Use Keyboard Shortcuts</h2><p>MacBook Air OS supports certain keyboard shortcuts to start screen recording and taking screenshots. You can either take a screenshot using the shortcut keys or record your screen by bringing in the tools on the screen To bring the screen recording tools menu on Mac, all you need is to press “Command + Shift + 4”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macbook-air-os-use-keyboard-shortcuts.jpg"                      alt="macbook air os use keyboard shortcuts"                ></p><p>After pressing you will be prompted to application windows as shown in the figure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macbook-recorder-settings.jpg"                      alt="macbook recorder settings"                ></p><p>Once the application window appears, you must know what each icon on the window means. On the left side of the window, as you can see, you can manage the screenshot of your screen either in full or of some windows or areas. Next is the middle area, which gives you two modes for screen recording, fullscreen mode to record your screen or choose a certain area to record from the screen as shown above in the figure. You can access all the recording settings before pressing to record your screen.</p><p>**<strong>Recording Settings:</strong></p><p>Before starting your screen recording it’s important to adjust for different recording settings as shown in the figure below. Just click the “options” in the main GUI of the recorder to show it up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macbook-click-the-options.jpg"                      alt="macbook click the options"                ></p><p>You can select your destination folder for saving your records using the “save to” bar in the settings. Set the timer up to 5 and 10 seconds if you short version video. You can also set to record both visual and audio from the screen using the microphone settings. In the end, you are left with other options of showing a floating thumbnail on your recording or keeping the last settings you have done here with the “Remember last selection option”. These are the options you can adjust before starting your screen record.</p><p>To stop recording all you have to do is press the small icon that appears in the top-right corner of your desktop screen. Visit your selected destination folder of the recording and bingo you can enjoy your screen recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macbook-stop-recording.jpg"                      alt="macbook stop recording"                ></p><p>**<strong>Other Shortcut Keys:</strong></p><p>Other shortcut keys that can be used to take screenshots and screen recording let’s have a look at the following table.</p><table><thead><tr><th>**<strong>Shortcut Key</strong></th><th>**<strong>Function</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Shift + Command + 3</td><td>Take a Full Screenshot.</td></tr><tr><td>Shift + Command + 4</td><td>Capturing a portion of the screen</td></tr><tr><td>Shift + Command + 4 + Spacebar</td><td>Take a screenshot of a certain window.</td></tr><tr><td>Shift + Command + 5</td><td>Bring you the screenshot and screen recording tools</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Part-2-Use-QuickTime-Player"><a href="#Part-2-Use-QuickTime-Player" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Use QuickTime Player"></a>Part 2: Use QuickTime Player</h2><p>Another hidden application in your MacBook Air utility program that already comes built-in with Mac OS is QuickTime Player. With this player, you can easily record your screen and take screenshots along the system audio as well as microphone input. To access this application and utilize it for your purpose all you need is to follow the steps given in the coming section.</p><p>First, you will need to look into your applications row on your desktop screen. You will probably see the QuickTime player icon there. Right-click on the icon and start the new screen recorder to access the application. Or you can use the other method to access it with QuickTime open from the upper bar as shown in the figure below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quicktime-player-row-on-desktop-screen.jpg"                      alt="quicktime player row on desktop screen"                ></p><p>Once you are done with launching the GUI of the application, it’s time to learn how can you start recording now. Before starting your recording with the red icon of the start button as shown it is important to choose whether you want microphone input to be recorded or not. You can easily do it by enabling the internal microphone in the settings as shown in the figure. Once you are done with the settings it’s time to start your recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quciktime-internal-microphone.jpg"                      alt="quciktime internal microphone"                ></p><p>Click on the start recording button and you will see a new window will pop up to choose the screen recording mode from it as shown in the figure below. To record in the full-screen recording mode you just need to click randomly on the screen once and it will start recording the whole screen. Otherwise, drag and select a particular area on the screen and click start recording once shown and you will have the recording of the particular screen area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quicktime-drag-and-drop-on-screen.jpg"                      alt="quicktime drag and drop on screen"                ></p><p>Finally, if you are needed to stop recording, all you have to do is click on the QuickTime player icon in the application bar and select stop recording as shown. After doing so, you will be left with the untitled video of your recording that you can play through the player.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quicktime-stop-screen-recording-option.jpg"                      alt="quicktime stop screen recording option"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4631056&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/997e65474a248252883b485717f7d098/products/buy-windows.png"                      border="0"                >Allavsoft Batch Download Online Videos, Music Offline to MP4, MP3, MOV, etc format </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Use-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-Use-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Use Filmora"></a>Part 3: Use Filmora</h2><p>Another cool way to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record your screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on Macbook Air is using Filmora.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Essential-Guide-to-Using-OBS-for-YouTube-Twitch"><a href="#Essential-Guide-to-Using-OBS-for-YouTube-Twitch" class="headerlink" title="Essential Guide to Using OBS for YouTube &amp; Twitch"></a>Essential Guide to Using OBS for YouTube &amp; Twitch</h2><h2 id="Part-1-Introduction"><a href="#Part-1-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Introduction"></a>Part 1: Introduction</h2><p>If you want to enhance your audience reach, consider multi-streaming to Twitch and your other preferred sites. Mainstreaming enables you to broadcast on Twitch and YouTube or stream on Twitch and Facebook, or all three! At the same time, with everyone spending more time indoors amid the global crisis, it appears we’re all seeking a diversion and many gamers are asking themselves how to broadcast on YouTube or Twitch. One of the easiest methods to broadcast on Twitch and YouTube Gaming at the same time is via OBS. Streamers may broadcast to more than 30 streaming platforms concurrently using an easy-to-understand user interface. The service is created in a manner that won’t place any demand on your PC hardware or the bandwidth you have available.</p><p>Well, it all boils down to choosing. But if you want to know the streaming networks with the highest traffic, those platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming. Twitch is a mainstreaming service that enables you to broadcast on more than 30 of your favorite platforms simultaneously. It merely takes a few minutes to join your numerous live streaming accounts and interact directly with the popular encoding program OBS. You may also multi streams on Twitch and your other favorite streaming services. Knowing what the correct gear is when you’re starting as a streamer may be intimidating, but we come with good news. Nowadays the entry-level for streaming has reduced quite a bit owing to hardware becoming more affordable, but also because many PCs are already prepared to manage a broadcast or can be readily updated to support one.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Stream-to-Twitch-with-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-Stream-to-Twitch-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Stream to Twitch with OBS"></a>Part 2: Stream to Twitch with OBS</h2><p>If you want to obtain the very greatest quality broadcast, you’re searching for some fantastic software. In the case of Windows, one of the most common solutions is Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) (OBS). Many people are first drawn to OBS since it’s free to use owing to being open source. Luckily, it’s also a feature-rich piece of software that can handle practically anything you throw at it. If you’re new to OBS or to streaming in general, it might be a bit frightening at first.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=28010250&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/336__280a.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-1-Getting-a-Stream-Key-from-Twitch"><a href="#Step-1-Getting-a-Stream-Key-from-Twitch" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Getting a Stream Key from Twitch"></a>Step 1. Getting a Stream Key from Twitch</h3><p>Before you stream anything anyplace, you need to provide OBS with the credentials to broadcast on your channel. Exactly how you do this on the large number of services OBS supports may differ, but I’m covering Twitch for this instruction.</p><p>In all circumstances, you need to either produce a stream key in your account settings on the appropriate provider or link your account to OBS if it’s supported like it is on Twitch. Simply signing in with your credentials is by far the simplest approach, and OBS utilizes streaming, so you’re not providing any of your personal login information directly to it. YouTube likewise offers a similar kind of authentication.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitch.jpg"                      alt="twitch"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Installing-and-Setting-OBS"><a href="#Step-2-Installing-and-Setting-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Step 2. Installing and Setting OBS"></a>Step 2. Installing and Setting OBS</h3><p>OBS Studio is available for all main operating systems such as Windows, Mac OS, and, Linux. You may get the utility by clicking here. Run and install the software to get started. When you launch the program for the first time, OBS Studio performs an Auto-Configuration Wizard. It provides you the choice of selecting between ‘Optimize for streaming’ and ‘Optimize for recording’. Click on the ‘Optimize for streaming’ if you wish to live broadcast your game. The wizard will next examine your system’s performance. It examines and helps adjust your system resolution, bitrate, encoder, and internet connection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/installing-and-setting-obs.jpg"                      alt="installing and setting obs"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1793213">                    <video width="1080" height="1620" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793213">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:1080px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftinyland.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1793213%2F19135'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793213/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### Step 3\. Configuring OBS Studio for Streaming to Twitch<p>Now that you’re set up to the stream, the first step is to select your resolution, frame rate, and bitrate. The greater each of them, the more bandwidth and horsepower you’ll require from your PC. If you’ve got a high-speed internet connection and a strong PC, then you can probably stream at 1080p60 at a high bitrate. But you also need to balance this with offering a stream that’s not going to buffer like wild for your viewers who could be on poorer connections. Remember, if you’re not a partner on Twitch, you won’t have transcoding, thus the experience might be awful for viewers with sluggish connections.</p><p>Once you’re done setting up OBS, you can dig into the advanced capabilities such as OBS sceneries. These will allow you to dramatically boost your live stream production value. If you arrange your OBS scenes and sources appropriately, your broadcast may go from an ordinary-looking stream to one that appears slick and professional.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/configuring-obs-studio.jpg"                      alt="configuring obs studio"                ></p><h3 id="Step-4-Adding-Scene-and-Sources"><a href="#Step-4-Adding-Scene-and-Sources" class="headerlink" title="Step 4. Adding Scene and Sources"></a>Step 4. Adding Scene and Sources</h3><p>A scene may be simply added in OBS by clicking on the addition symbol indicated in the picture below. Once you have chosen this, you will simply be prompted to pick a name for the scene. All of your overlays, sources, and basic on-screen items will need to be introduced through a specified scene. Once you have created your scene and titled it, make sure it is chosen and proceed to the box on the right side of the picture below to click the plus symbol. This brings up the many sources you may pick from for your freshly constructed scenario. The good thing is, once you have inserted a source in one scene, you can simply use it again in another.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adding-scene-and-sources.jpg"                      alt="adding scene and sources"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920047/21774" target="_top" id="1920047"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920047"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920047/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-5-Adding-a-Twitch-Chat"><a href="#Step-5-Adding-a-Twitch-Chat" class="headerlink" title="Step 5. Adding a Twitch Chat"></a>Step 5. Adding a Twitch Chat</h3><p>Adding your twitch chat to your broadcasts may help make your viewers feel more included by enabling them to see their message live on the screen. You may add your Twitch chat box to your live broadcast in OBS by utilizing the browser source. The best practice when employing a chat box is to make sure to have your visuals, displays, and overlays set up to accommodate it. Get the widget URL from your favorite provider and copy it to your clipboard. This is what you will be adding to your OBS sources to add the chat to your overlay. If you’re using Twitch, this will be provided to you once you pick your basic settings for your chat style and layout. In the “Sources” section of OBS, go to the “+” in the bottom left corner, and pick, “Browser” to create a new browser source window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitch-chat.jpg"                      alt="twitch chat"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4728277&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f7f07e7dab09533bc71247a5b29a7373/products/1_iDeviceMessageBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Stream-to-YouTube-with-OBS"><a href="#Part-3-Stream-to-YouTube-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Stream to YouTube with OBS"></a>Part 3: Stream to YouTube with OBS</h2><p>You may get it by browsing OBS Studio’s official website. If you’re using Windows 11, you shouldn’t be concerned about compatibility, since OBS is completely tuned to function with it. You may also broadcast game videos on YouTube. YouTube Gaming is a service devoted to gaming content providers and their viewers. Similar to Twitch and Facebook Gaming, it’s YouTube’s area for the gaming community. Once you’re done downloading and installing OBS, run it. You should be welcomed with a window with a dark screen and objects below it.</p><p>**<strong>Get your YouTube Stream Key</strong></p><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a YouTube account if you haven’t already</p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> You can’t participate in YouTube live broadcasting unless you authenticate the account using a connected cell phone.

The PlayStation 2 was released to compete with Nintendo’s SNES, which ruled the console video-gaming market for years. Sony launched its first-ever gaming console after years of reorganizations and partnerships, including ones with Nintendo. The console was immensely successful until its successor replaced it.</p><p>With the PS1 emulator for PC, you can play PlayStation 1 games. Play your favorite PlayStation games on your computer with the original BIOS, your own BIOS, and your own games. Listed below, you will find some of the best PS1 emulators that will allow you to relive those days. If you have an original game disk, even better. All you need is a copy of the disc image.</p><h3 id="1-RetroArch-Emulator"><a href="#1-RetroArch-Emulator" class="headerlink" title="1.RetroArch Emulator"></a>1.RetroArch Emulator</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/retroarch-emulator-ps1.png"                      alt="retroarch-emulator-ps1"                ></p><p>This emulator offers a variety of solutions and is just an emulator for playing PS1 video games, making it one of the best ps 1 emulators and most complete emulators. The first stable version was released in the year 2020, almost a decade after its launch in the year 2010. On top of all that, it is free, open-source, and can emulate gaming consoles, media players, game engines, and others. That makes it a very reliable emulator.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Multiple platforms are supported, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.</li><li>As a fast, portable, lightweight emulator, RetroArch requires no adjustments or very little tweaking to run and function properly.</li><li>In terms of game-saving, refresh rate, game loading, and screen resolution, it is one of the best PS1 emulators out there.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Matsu-Emulator"><a href="#2-Matsu-Emulator" class="headerlink" title="2.Matsu Emulator"></a>2.Matsu Emulator</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/matsu-emulator-ps1.png"                      alt="matsu-emulator-ps1"                ></p><p>There is also the Matsu Emulator, which is based on the PSX&#x2F;PSOne platform. Despite being one of the best emulators in the world, it is also quite stable and safe. There are more and more features being added to the software. In contrast, the simulator works well but the free version has heavy advertising. If you purchase the pro edition in the game, you will be able to remove the advertisements. If you would like to pay someone for an emulator, we would recommend ePSXe or FPse.

In terms of quality, precision, and compatibility, its original cores (built to run PS1, Sega Saturn, and Nintendo Virtual Boy games) are noteworthy.
