These might be due to unmanaged positioning of the hardware devices, improper configurations of the <strong>Zoom audio settings</strong>, or both. Some of the most common Zoom audio problems and their possible solutions are discussed below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-audio-advanced-settings.jpg"                      alt=" Zoom Meeting Settings Advanced Audio Settings "                ></p><h4 id="Zoom-Audio-Issue-1-Audio-Feedback-Loop"><a href="#Zoom-Audio-Issue-1-Audio-Feedback-Loop" class="headerlink" title="Zoom Audio Issue 1: Audio Feedback Loop"></a>Zoom Audio Issue 1: Audio Feedback Loop</h4><h5 id="What-Is-It"><a href="#What-Is-It" class="headerlink" title="What Is It?"></a>What Is It?</h5><p>Audio feedback loop is when your voice keeps repeating itself for an indefinite number of times and never stops whatsoever.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >6 Top Voice Changer for Zoom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h5 id="How-It-Happens"><a href="#How-It-Happens" class="headerlink" title="How It Happens?"></a>How It Happens?</h5><p>When you are using external speakers and microphone, and both are placed nearby, any sound that comes out of the speaker is received by the microphone. If Zoom is configured to accept sounds from system audio, the mic sends the signals back to the speakers that again send the audio output to the mic. Since this iteration never ends, you continuously hear an audio feedback loop.</p><h5 id="How-to-Resolve-the-Audio-Loop-in-Zoom-Meeting"><a href="#How-to-Resolve-the-Audio-Loop-in-Zoom-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to Resolve the Audio Loop in Zoom Meeting?"></a>How to Resolve the Audio Loop in Zoom Meeting?</h5><p>In order to eliminate this issue, make sure to place both microphone and speakers at a safe distance from each other. This would prevent the microphone from receiving any output from the speakers, and the chain of audio feedback loop would never take place.</p><h4 id="Zoom-Audio-Issue-2-Background-Noise"><a href="#Zoom-Audio-Issue-2-Background-Noise" class="headerlink" title="Zoom Audio Issue 2: Background Noise"></a>Zoom Audio Issue 2: Background Noise</h4><h5 id="What-Is-It-1"><a href="#What-Is-It-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is It?"></a>What Is It?</h5><p>Background noise is the distortion or humming that you hear during an audio call on zoom.</p><h5 id="Why-I-hear-background-noise-in-Zoom-Meeting"><a href="#Why-I-hear-background-noise-in-Zoom-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="Why I hear background noise in Zoom Meeting?"></a>Why I hear background noise in Zoom Meeting?</h5><p>If you have a highly sensitive microphone that is mostly used by professionals or in recording studios, the chances are that it will catch a lot of background noise during a Zoom meeting.</p><h5 id="How-to-remove-the-background-noise-in-Zoom-meeting"><a href="#How-to-remove-the-background-noise-in-Zoom-meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to remove the background noise in Zoom meeting?"></a>How to remove the background noise in Zoom meeting?</h5><p>This issue can be resolved by either hosting or joining a meeting in a closed, soundproof room, or using a less sensitive mic. It would be best if you use a normal headset that is easily available in any local electronic shop. You can also try enabling the <strong>Automatically adjust volume</strong> option from the <strong>Microphone</strong> section of the <strong>Audio</strong> category of the <strong>Settings</strong> box as explained earlier in <strong>Step 3</strong> of the <strong>Zoom Audio Settings When Not in Meeting</strong> section.</p><h4 id="Zoom-Audio-Issue-3-Echo"><a href="#Zoom-Audio-Issue-3-Echo" class="headerlink" title="Zoom Audio Issue 3: Echo"></a>Zoom Audio Issue 3: Echo</h4><h5 id="What-Is-It-2"><a href="#What-Is-It-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is It?"></a>What Is It?</h5><p><strong>Zoom audio echo</strong> is when you hear an echo sound during an ongoing Zoom meeting with audio enabled.</p><h5 id="How-It-Happens-1"><a href="#How-It-Happens-1" class="headerlink" title="How It Happens?"></a>How It Happens?</h5><p>Echo happens when you are on a laptop and are using onboard speakers and microphone, and that too with the speaker or mic volume set to maximum.</p><h5 id="How-to-remove-the-echo-in-the-Zoom-meeting"><a href="#How-to-remove-the-echo-in-the-Zoom-meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to remove the echo in the Zoom meeting?"></a>How to remove the echo in the Zoom meeting?</h5><p>As mentioned earlier, it is always advisable to use a headset to avoid any such unwanted echo or audio feedback loop issues. In case you don’t have access to a headset, try configuring the microphone settings to automatically adjust the volume, and not putting the speaker volume to the max.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Configuring <strong>Zoom audio settings</strong> before hosting or joining a meeting is always a wise approach to avoid any audio inconsistencies during an ongoing conference. However, if you are already in one, you can use the methods given above to configure the microphone settings to get the audio right. You are also encouraged to use an average quality headset during a Zoom meeting to avoid any <strong>Zoom audio echo</strong>, feedback loop, or background noises.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Improve Video Quality in Zoom Meetings? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-beginners-path-to-filming-with-macbook-webcam/"><u>[New] Beginner's Path to Filming with MacBook Webcam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-how-to-record-videos-in-complete-silence/"><u>[New] How to Record Videos in Complete Silence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-mastering-the-art-of-deleting-discord-servers/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Mastering the Art of Deleting Discord Servers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-master-photo-editing-seamless-integration-of-timestamps/"><u>[Updated] Master Photo Editing Seamless Integration of Timestamps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-plain-screeners-toolkit-for-win10-users/"><u>2024 Approved Plain Screener's Toolkit for Win10 Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-step-by-step-guide-integrating-audio-into-your-reels/"><u>2024 Approved Step-by-Step Guide Integrating Audio Into Your Reels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-essential-handbook-for-incorporating-music-into-ppt/"><u>2024 Approved The Essential Handbook for Incorporating Music Into PPT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/advanced-techniques-for-quality-audio-on-ipads-for-2024/"><u>Advanced Techniques for Quality Audio on iPads for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/beginners-blueprint-for-yourwebcamrecord/"><u>Beginner's Blueprint for YourWebcamRecord</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/best-5-rapid-setup-techniques-for-home-cinematography-for-2024/"><u>Best 5 Rapid Setup Techniques for Home Cinematography for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/crafting-flawless-transcriptions-googles-speech-magic-for-2024/"><u>Crafting Flawless Transcriptions Google’s Speech Magic for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/exploring-high-definition-chroma-blade-photography/"><u>Exploring High-Definition Chroma Blade Photography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/exquisite-note-taking-experience-on-mematic/"><u>Exquisite Note-Taking Experience on Mematic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/gaming-evolution-top-7-stardew-valley-enhancements-7/"><u>Gaming Evolution Top 7 Stardew Valley Enhancements (#7)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/pokemon-go-no-gps-signal-heres-every-possible-solution-on-itel-p55plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Pokemon Go No GPS Signal?

Some of the most common Zoom audio problems and their possible solutions are discussed below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-audio-advanced-settings.jpg"                      alt=" Zoom Meeting Settings Advanced Audio Settings "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130869/7443" target="_top" id="2130869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="Zoom-Audio-Issue-1-Audio-Feedback-Loop"><a href="#Zoom-Audio-Issue-1-Audio-Feedback-Loop" class="headerlink" title="Zoom Audio Issue 1: Audio Feedback Loop"></a>Zoom Audio Issue 1: Audio Feedback Loop</h4><h5 id="What-Is-It"><a href="#What-Is-It" class="headerlink" title="What Is It?"></a>What Is It?</h5><p>Audio feedback loop is when your voice keeps repeating itself for an indefinite number of times and never stops whatsoever.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >6 Top Voice Changer for Zoom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h5 id="How-It-Happens"><a href="#How-It-Happens" class="headerlink" title="How It Happens?"></a>How It Happens?</h5><p>When you are using external speakers and microphone, and both are placed nearby, any sound that comes out of the speaker is received by the microphone. If Zoom is configured to accept sounds from system audio, the mic sends the signals back to the speakers that again send the audio output to the mic. Since this iteration never ends, you continuously hear an audio feedback loop.</p><h5 id="How-to-Resolve-the-Audio-Loop-in-Zoom-Meeting"><a href="#How-to-Resolve-the-Audio-Loop-in-Zoom-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to Resolve the Audio Loop in Zoom Meeting?"></a>How to Resolve the Audio Loop in Zoom Meeting?</h5><p>In order to eliminate this issue, make sure to place both microphone and speakers at a safe distance from each other. This would prevent the microphone from receiving any output from the speakers, and the chain of audio feedback loop would never take place.</p><h4 id="Zoom-Audio-Issue-2-Background-Noise"><a href="#Zoom-Audio-Issue-2-Background-Noise" class="headerlink" title="Zoom Audio Issue 2: Background Noise"></a>Zoom Audio Issue 2: Background Noise</h4><h5 id="What-Is-It-1"><a href="#What-Is-It-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is It?"></a>What Is It?</h5><p>Background noise is the distortion or humming that you hear during an audio call on zoom.</p><h5 id="Why-I-hear-background-noise-in-Zoom-Meeting"><a href="#Why-I-hear-background-noise-in-Zoom-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="Why I hear background noise in Zoom Meeting?"></a>Why I hear background noise in Zoom Meeting?</h5><p>If you have a highly sensitive microphone that is mostly used by professionals or in recording studios, the chances are that it will catch a lot of background noise during a Zoom meeting.</p><h5 id="How-to-remove-the-background-noise-in-Zoom-meeting"><a href="#How-to-remove-the-background-noise-in-Zoom-meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to remove the background noise in Zoom meeting?"></a>How to remove the background noise in Zoom meeting?</h5><p>This issue can be resolved by either hosting or joining a meeting in a closed, soundproof room, or using a less sensitive mic. It would be best if you use a normal headset that is easily available in any local electronic shop. You can also try enabling the <strong>Automatically adjust volume</strong> option from the <strong>Microphone</strong> section of the <strong>Audio</strong> category of the <strong>Settings</strong> box as explained earlier in <strong>Step 3</strong> of the <strong>Zoom Audio Settings When Not in Meeting</strong> section.</p><h4 id="Zoom-Audio-Issue-3-Echo"><a href="#Zoom-Audio-Issue-3-Echo" class="headerlink" title="Zoom Audio Issue 3: Echo"></a>Zoom Audio Issue 3: Echo</h4><h5 id="What-Is-It-2"><a href="#What-Is-It-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is It?"></a>What Is It?</h5><p><strong>Zoom audio echo</strong> is when you hear an echo sound during an ongoing Zoom meeting with audio enabled.</p><h5 id="How-It-Happens-1"><a href="#How-It-Happens-1" class="headerlink" title="How It Happens?"></a>How It Happens?</h5><p>Echo happens when you are on a laptop and are using onboard speakers and microphone, and that too with the speaker or mic volume set to maximum.</p><h5 id="How-to-remove-the-echo-in-the-Zoom-meeting"><a href="#How-to-remove-the-echo-in-the-Zoom-meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to remove the echo in the Zoom meeting?"></a>How to remove the echo in the Zoom meeting?</h5><p>As mentioned earlier, it is always advisable to use a headset to avoid any such unwanted echo or audio feedback loop issues. In case you don’t have access to a headset, try configuring the microphone settings to automatically adjust the volume, and not putting the speaker volume to the max.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Configuring <strong>Zoom audio settings</strong> before hosting or joining a meeting is always a wise approach to avoid any audio inconsistencies during an ongoing conference. However, if you are already in one, you can use the methods given above to configure the microphone settings to get the audio right. You are also encouraged to use an average quality headset during a Zoom meeting to avoid any <strong>Zoom audio echo</strong>, feedback loop, or background noises.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Improve Video Quality in Zoom Meetings? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-comprehensive-snapshot-service-azs-app-testing/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Comprehensive Snapshot Service - AZ's App Testing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-comprehensive-guide-to-capturing-lol-games/"><u>[New] In 2024, Comprehensive Guide to Capturing LOL Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-cutting-edge-mac-cam-apps-a-look-past-bandicam/"><u>[New] In 2024, Cutting-Edge Mac Cam Apps A Look Past Bandicam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-grand-adventures-reimagined-post-gta-v-lineup/"><u>[New] In 2024, Grand Adventures Reimagined - Post-GTA V Lineup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/1715971160458-new-in-2024-how-to-fix-obs-studio-drop-frames-issue/"><u>[New] In 2024, How To Fix OBS Studio Drop Frames Issue</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-mastering-the-art-of-twilight-portraits-for-2024/"><u>[New] Mastering the Art of Twilight Portraits for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-outsmarting-tiktoks-unseen-ban-a-recovery-plan/"><u>[New] Outsmarting TikTok's Unseen Ban A Recovery Plan</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-the-key-to-smooth-screencasting-a-macos-guide-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Key to Smooth Screencasting A MacOS Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-discover-the-best-video-capture-tools-for-windows-users/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Discover the Best Video Capture Tools for Windows Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-leading-edge-top-5-modern-video-capture-solutions/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Leading Edge Top 5 Modern Video Capture Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-live-broadcast-faceoff-obs-vs-shadowtoolkit/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Live Broadcast Faceoff OBS Vs.

If you have subscribed to any free or paid webinar, you should be ready to record the webinar so that you can go through the webinar at any future instance.

If you want to record webinar free, we have lined up the best webinar recording software applications.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Record-Webinar-on-PC"><a href="#Part-1-Record-Webinar-on-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

You will get a buffer time to go to the webinar. You can press F9 key to start recording just after the webinar starts.</p><p>Step 4: Once the webinar ends, click on Stop button or press F9 key again to stop recording. Edit and export the recording to save it on your computer.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Record-Webinar-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-Record-Webinar-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Record Webinar on Mac"></a>Part 2. Record Webinar on Mac</h2><p>Things get easy for you if you are a Mac user. You can record any webinar on your Mac without installing any external application. You can free record webinar with QuickTime Player that comes pre-installed on Mac. You can play the recording on QuickTime itself and hence, there is not going to be any compatibility issue. Here are the steps on how to record webinar free with QuickTime Player.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quicktime-new-movie-recording.jpg"                      alt="obs setup"                ></p><p>Step 1: Launch QuickTime Player from Applications folder. Go to File &gt; New Screen Recording option.</p><p>Step 2: When the webinar is about to start, click on the Record button from QuickTime widget.</p><p>Step 3: When the webinar gets over, press the Stop button. To save the recorded webinar, go to File&gt; Save option.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Record-Webinar-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Record-Webinar-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to Record Webinar on iPhone"></a>Part 3. How to Record Webinar on iPhone</h2><p>If you are attending any webinar from your iPhone, you can go for free record webinar without installing any third-party app. This is because iOS 11 and above comes with a built-in screen recorder through which you can record anything on your iPhone screen. You can find the screen recorder on the Control Center. If it is not available, you have to go to Settings&gt; Control Center &gt; Screen Recording and turn on the screen recorder option. Here are the steps on how to record webinar on iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="iphone screen recorder"                ></p><p>Step 1: Open the webinar on your screen that you want to record.</p><p>Step 2: Pull down Control Centre on your iPhone. Tap on Screen Recording option.</p><p>Step 3: From the pop-up message, tap on Start Recording option to start recording. Make sure you turn off the microphone.</p><p>Step 4: When you want to stop recording, tap on the Red icon at the top-left corner.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Record-Webinar-on-Android-Phones"><a href="#Part-4-Record-Webinar-on-Android-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Record Webinar on Android Phones"></a>Part 4. Record Webinar on Android Phones</h2><p>Unlike iPhone, most Android phones do not have a built-in screen recorder. That is why you have to install an external screen recorder app to record webinar for free. However, you have to be careful while choosing an external screen recorder because some of them could be spyware app. We recommend Mobizen screen recorder app which comes with all the required features and necessary security. The app does not save the recorded video on their servers but only on the user’s device. There is no signing up required as you can record your screen instantly. Here are the steps on how to record webinar for free with Mobizen screen recorder.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mobizen-screenrecorder.jpg"                      alt="mobizen screen recorder"                ></p><p>Step 1: Install Mobizen screen recorder app from Play Store.</p><p>Step 2: Launch the app and you will see Mobizen recording widget on your screen.</p><p>Step 3: Open the webinar that you want to record. Tap on Video Camera icon from the widget to start recording.</p><p>Step 4: To stop recording, tap on Stop button and you will find the recorded video on your phone gallery.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137225/26400" target="_top" id="2137225">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137225" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137225/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-Online-Webinar-Recording"><a href="#Part-5-Online-Webinar-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. Online Webinar Recording"></a>Part 5. Online Webinar Recording</h2><p>If you do not want to go for any webinar recording software free download on your computer, you can opt for an online screen recorder.
