However, did you know that to use the features of Google Meet, you must create or schedule a meeting beforehand? This not only makes the entire online video conferencing process more organized, but it streamlines it as well! This way users can create a session link for their team and share it with them manually and by inviting other users to the event.</p><p>Many wonder <strong>how to create Google Meet links</strong>, but have no fear! We are here to help you create and <strong>schedule Google Meet</strong> sessions.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1"> Creating a Google Meet on Laptop?

Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Gmail"></a>1. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Gmail</h3><p>Scheduling a session through Gmail is fairly simple, for this all the user requires is access to a Gmail account and they are good to go. First what one must do is sign into their Gmail account and go to the homepage.</p><p>On the left side of their screen, they will see options under the “Meet” heading, one is “New Meeting” and the other is “Join a Meeting”. If you are looking to create a new meeting then click on the “New Meeting” option.</p><p>Once that option is clicked, the user will be redirected to a new page that contains a meeting link.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gmail-google-meet-invitation-link.jpg"                      alt=" google meet invitation link on Gmail"                ></p><p>Over here there are three options. By clicking the “copy link” button, individuals can copy and share the link with people they would like to invite to the meeting.</p><p>If they want to directly share the link, they can also click the “Send Invite” button and copy the meeting invite from there as well as share via email.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-google-meet-invite-link-gmail.jpg"                      alt="share google meet invitation link on Gmail"                ></p><p>Upon clicking the “Share Via Email” option, users will be redirected to a new tab where they can see an email pop up and from there, they can invite participants to the session through their email address, as indicated in the image below.</p><p>If individuals want to instantly create and start the session, they can click the “Start Now” option, and the meeting will automatically start.</p><h3 id="2-Creating-Google-Meet-Sessions-Through-Google-Calendar"><a href="#2-Creating-Google-Meet-Sessions-Through-Google-Calendar" class="headerlink" title="2. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Google Calendar"></a>2. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Google Calendar</h3><p>Another way to create a Google Meet session is through the Google Calendar. Much like the process of creating it through Gmail, there are a few steps involved, but the process is very easy.</p><p>First individuals must go to the Google Calendar homepage and click the “Create” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-google-meet-session-google-calendar.jpg"                      alt="create google meet  on google calendar"                ></p><p>After clicking the create option, the screen will show two options; “ Event” and “Task”. Click the event option and a pop-up form will show up on the window which must be filled to create a Google Meet event.</p><p>Fill in the form, if you would like to invite participants to the Google Meet conference, you can also list down their email address in the “Add Guests” section. Once you have done that click the “Add Google Meet Video Conferencing” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-google-meet-video-conferencing-calendar.jpg"                      alt="add google meet  on google calendar"                ></p><p>An event link will appear in the form, along with a button that says “Join With Google Meet”. Once you are done filling in the form, click “Save”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/join-google-meet-via-google-calendar-link.jpg"                      alt="join google meet  via  google calendar link"                ></p><p>If you are looking to join the conference instantly, click the “Join With Google Meet” option and you will be redirected to the conference. If you would like to join later, you can copy the joining link and search it on the Google search bar to be redirected to the conference.</p><h3 id="3-Creating-Google-Meet-Sessions-Through-Google-Meet"><a href="#3-Creating-Google-Meet-Sessions-Through-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="3. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Google Meet"></a>3. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Google Meet</h3><p>Did you know you can directly create a conference through the Google Meet homepage as well? All you have to do is go to the Google Meet homepage and click the “New Meeting” button.</p><p>Upon clicking the button, you will see three options. From that click the “Start an Instant Meeting” option and you will be redirected to a new conference.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-schedule-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="Create schedule google meet"                ></p><p>These are the three highly recommended ways to create a Google Meet session instantly, but remember, to make use of any of these options, you must have a Gmail account.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Create-Google-Meet-on-Android-iPhone-iPad"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Create-Google-Meet-on-Android-iPhone-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Create Google Meet on Android&#x2F;iPhone&#x2F;iPad?"></a>Part 2: How to Create Google Meet on Android&#x2F;iPhone&#x2F;iPad?</h2><p>Google Meet comes with an option for groups to create video conferences on their mobile and tablet devices as well.

Users may meet face to face, communicate with associates via in-meeting chatting or conference call, &amp; share their presentations via screen sharing.</p><p>Meetings may be accessed via a PC, Mac, iOS, or Android device. All GoToMeeting sessions (also known as webinars) can be recorded. This article explains how to record a <strong>gotomeeting recording</strong> session in detail, including a step-by-step approach.</p><p>Part 1. <a href="#part1">How to Record in GoToMeeting with Built-in Recorder</a></p><p>Part 2. <a href="#part2">Use the Best GoToMeeting Recorder on PC</a></p><p>Part 3. <a href="#part3">Record GoToMeeting with an Online Recorder</a></p><p>Part 4. <a href="#part4">Record GoToMeeting on iPhone and Android</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Record-in-GoToMeeting-with-Built-in-Recorder"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Record-in-GoToMeeting-with-Built-in-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to Record in GoToMeeting with Built-in Recorder"></a>Part 1. How to Record in GoToMeeting with Built-in Recorder</h2><p>Meetings can be recorded using the built-in <strong>gotomeeting recording</strong> option, but there are limits.</p><p>However, recording options must be set up before the commencement of the session. You can only record meetings using GoToMeeting’s meeting recorder if you have a premium account and admin authorization, making it a much less convenient option to record meetings.</p><p>Step 1. Just click over the “REC” icon at the top of the GoToMeeting screen once you have joined a meeting to record.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gotomeeting-start-record.jpg"                      alt="gotomeeting start record"                ></p><p>Step 2. While recording, click “Start Your Recording,” and the “REC” icon will become red. The recording of the meeting will be announced to all participants.</p><p>Step 3. Click over the “REC” icon and choose “Stop Your Recording” to stop the recording. If you’re making a local recording, the Recording Manager will open up and ask you to convert the video. However, if you’re doing a cloud recording, you’ll be sent to your online account to retrieve the footage. It takes some time for new recordings to appear in the cloud recording history.</p><p>Step 4. However, what if other participants, such as not account owners or organizers, wish to record live sessions? In this instance, you’ll need a video-recording program that works on both PCs and Macs.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Use-the-Best-GoToMeeting-Recorder-on-PC"><a href="#Part-2-Use-the-Best-GoToMeeting-Recorder-on-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Use the Best GoToMeeting Recorder on PC"></a>Part 2. Use the Best GoToMeeting Recorder on PC</h2><p>The built-in recorder for GoToMeeting has several restrictions that make many users look for a third-party application to record meetings. Work is cumbersome due to constraints. As a result, it is preferable to seek a substitute. A good <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recorder Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to <strong>record gotomeeting webinar</strong> may make your job a lot simpler and more productive.</p><p>Wondershare Filmora is a suitable alternative.

Finally, the video will be instantly uploaded to the media library.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Record-GoToMeeting-with-an-Online-Recorder"><a href="#Part-3-Record-GoToMeeting-with-an-Online-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Despite Rockstar’s continued tease of GTA 6, most of us have already experienced that world since 2013. We’ve collected a few of our favorite GTA-inspired substitutes for you to enjoy in the meantime. We’ve compiled 10 games like GTA V to keep you occupied until we find out what’s next for the series.</p><h3 id="1-Red-Dead-Redemption-2"><a href="#1-Red-Dead-Redemption-2" class="headerlink" title="1.Red Dead Redemption 2"></a>1.Red Dead Redemption 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/red-dead-redemption-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="red-dead-redemption-2-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p>The same studio makes both the GTA series and Red Dead, so you can probably guess why that one’s here. As with its predecessor, Red Dead Redemption 2 has an open world that feels alive, and it never says away from including interesting details. Following an outlaw gang who hopes to pull one last heist before retiring, it is primarily a story of trust and betrayal. The story is not as simple as it seems, and many unexpected twists and turns are revealed. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a great game if you like GTA 5 with a Wild West theme and revolver weapons. Its setting is reminiscent of GTA’s belief in player freedom. If you’re in the mood for a Grand Theft Auto experience, Red Dead Redemption 2 is well worth your time.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Visuals and voice acting is incredible.</p><p>• Side quests and main missions that will thrill you.</p><p>• Many side distractions that are both ludicrous and delightful.</p><p>• You feel like you have gone back a century.</p><h3 id="2-Assassin’s-Creed-Origins"><a href="#2-Assassin’s-Creed-Origins" class="headerlink" title="2.Assassin’s Creed Origins"></a>2.Assassin’s Creed Origins</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/assassins-creed-origins-poster.jpg"                      alt="assassins-creed-origins-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Microsoft Windows, Google Stadia</p><p>The Assassin’s Creed series has increasingly emphasized open-world gameplay, making it a great choice for GTA 5 fans.

In the past, <strong>recording internal audio</strong> in Android is severely restricted by Google. However, KitKat version of Android OS has finally enabled Android Smartphone users to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record the screens <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on their devices, but recording the clear and perfect internal audio is not an easy job because of the Android OS policy that screen recording apps are not given the permission to record the internal sound of the Android phone or tablet after Android Lollipop version, recording the internal sound through microphone is a solution. Still, it picks up background noise while screen capturing is in progress.</p><p>So, how to create an internal audio recording on your Android devices?

This method of recording audio had many downsides, including poor audio quality and capturing of distracting background noises.</p><p>There are several different ways in which you can record system audio and avoid producing screen recordings with terrible sound. Each of the methods includes using third-party apps or screen capturing devices, since Android Lollipop and later versions of the Android OS, still don’t offer an effective solution to this problem.</p><h3 id="1-Use-Mobizen-Screen-Recorder-with-Internal-Audio-App-to-Record-the-internal-audio-on-Android"><a href="#1-Use-Mobizen-Screen-Recorder-with-Internal-Audio-App-to-Record-the-internal-audio-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Mobizen Screen Recorder with Internal Audio App to Record the internal audio on Android"></a>1. Use Mobizen Screen Recorder with Internal Audio App to Record the internal audio on Android</h3><p>Recently, RSUPPORT company developed the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rsupport.mvagent" >Mobizen Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app that is equipped with all the essential screen recording tools. At the same time, it also allows its users to record only sound produced by their Smartphones during the screen recording session. You can download this app for free on the Google Play store, but if you choose to install it on your Android phone, you should arm yourself with patience since this app contains ads.</p><p>After you’ve successfully installed Mobizen Screen Recorder on your Android Smartphone, you should launch the app and look for the Settings gear icon located in the upper right corner of your screen. Tap on the Sound option, and before proceeding any further, you should make sure that Sound is enabled. Once you allow the Sound feature, you’ll be able to see the Options menu that offers External and Internal features. By selecting the Internal option, you will instruct the app to record only the sound produced by the gameplay of the video game you are recording or a YouTube video you’re playing while the screen recording session is in progress.</p><p>The result you will get is the crystal clear audio in your screen recording, but Mobizen app performs well <strong>only with Samsung and LG Android phones</strong>, so if you have an Android device from some other manufacturer, this app may underperform.</p><h3 id="2-Record-the-internal-audio-from-a-microphone-on-Android-with-the-AZ-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#2-Record-the-internal-audio-from-a-microphone-on-Android-with-the-AZ-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="2. Record the internal audio from a microphone on Android with the AZ Screen Recorder"></a>2. Record the internal audio from a microphone on Android with the AZ Screen Recorder</h3><p>If you choose to utilize this method of recording internal audio, make sure that the room where your recording is completely silent since the microphone you will be using can pick up external sounds as well as internal audio.</p><p>You can download the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en" >AZ Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from the Google Play for free. Once the installation is complete, launch the app and tap on the Settings icon. This app won’t record sound until you enable this option, which is the reason why you should locate the Record Audio feature in the Settings menu.</p><p>At this point, you should exit the app, and click on the AZ bubble on the side of your Smartphone’s screen. Tap on the Record icon to start the screen recording session and proceed to perform all actions you wanted to capture with your Android device. The audio will be recorded simultaneously with the video. When ready, slide down the notification bar, and stop the screen recording session.</p><p>In order to extract the audio file, you’ll have to transfer the screen recording you made with AZ Screen Recorder to a PC and perform this action with a video editing software. You may have to create several screen recordings of your Smartphone’s screen before you get the perfect audio because the device’s microphone is going to capture all sound it can pick up, both external and internal.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Record-Android-internal-audio-with-a-capture-card"><a href="#Part-2-Record-Android-internal-audio-with-a-capture-card" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Record Android internal audio with a capture card"></a>Part 2: Record Android internal audio with a capture card</h2><p>Capture cards are much more than screen recorders since they mostly serve as a bridge between a PC and the device whose screen you are trying to capture. Professionals often use capture cards, despite their prices, simply because they enable them to record high-quality screen recordings, create live streams, and record internal audio from any device they are connected to, including Android Smartphones.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-capture-card.jpg"                      alt="Record Android games on PC with capture card"                ></p><p>Most capture cards are equipped with their own screen recording software, so the process of adjusting the video and audio settings depends on the capture card you have. If you have an <a class="link"   href="https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/downloads" >Elgato <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Capture Card you can have complete control over the audio recording process by using the Elgato Sound Capture feature. This powerful tool will enable you to mix sounds from multiple sources, select which microphones will be used during a live stream and adjust the music and sound volumes. However, if you want to use the Elgato, you need to make sure that your PC is compatible with this capture card, and you’ll have to connect your Android Smartphone with this device.</p><p>Using capture cards to record a screen on your Smartphone may be too expensive since capture cards are frequently used as a part of the professional gaming equipment used for streaming or capturing gameplay from games on Xbox or PS4.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Record-Android-Internal-Audio-with-Bandicam-and-the-Nox-Emulator"><a href="#Part-3-Record-Android-Internal-Audio-with-Bandicam-and-the-Nox-Emulator" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Record Android Internal Audio with Bandicam and the Nox Emulator"></a>Part 3: Record Android Internal Audio with Bandicam and the Nox Emulator</h2><p>Although this may not be the simplest way to record internal audio on your Smartphone device, it is probably the best solution if you want to create high-resolution screen recordings of your Smartphone’s screen and professional internal audio recordings at the same time.</p><p>Before you can start a recording session you must first install <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Bandicam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your PC. This software can be used for the production of high-quality screen recordings of your desktop, and it also offers excellent audio recording options.</p><p>Furthermore, you are going to need an Android emulator, an app that sends the pictures from your Android’s screen to a bigger screen, connected to your Android device. The <a class="link"   href="https://www.bignox.com/" >Nox App Player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will enable you to run the apps you want to record on your PC. There is a recording feature in the NOxPlayer Emulator, while the Bandicam software can be used to capture your desktop activities, as well as the system audio during a screen recording session. So, it is recommended to use both Bandicam and NoxPlayer to record audio in the video from Android phone on PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-android-games-pc-noxplayer.jpg"                      alt="Record Android games on PC"                ></p><p>This method of recording internal audio on an Android device is best used if you want to create high-resolution audio recordings that can later be edited and used in the final cut of the screen recording you produced with Bandicam software and the Nox App Player.</p><p>That’s the way that we figured out about how to record the internal sound on your Android phones and tablets.

In the past, <strong>recording internal audio</strong> in Android is severely restricted by Google. However, KitKat version of Android OS has finally enabled Android Smartphone users to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record the screens <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on their devices, but recording the clear and perfect internal audio is not an easy job because of the Android OS policy that screen recording apps are not given the permission to record the internal sound of the Android phone or tablet after Android Lollipop version, recording the internal sound through microphone is a solution. Still, it picks up background noise while screen capturing is in progress.</p><p>So, how to create an internal audio recording on your Android devices? While in this article, I will show you 4 different ways in the following 3 Parts to record your gameplay video with internal audio recording on Android phones or tablets without root.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Record system internal audio with Android screen recording apps</a></li><li><a href="#part1">Part 2: Record Android internal audio with a capture card</a></li><li><a href="#part1">Part 3: Record Android Internal Audio with Bandicam and the Nox Emulator</a></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><hr><h2 id="Part-1-Record-system-internal-audio-with-Android-screen-recording-apps-3"><a href="#Part-1-Record-system-internal-audio-with-Android-screen-recording-apps-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Record system internal audio with Android screen recording apps"></a>Part 1: Record system internal audio with Android screen recording apps</h2><p>For a long time, the only way to record the internal audio with an Android Smartphone was through the device’s external microphone. This method of recording audio had many downsides, including poor audio quality and capturing of distracting background noises.</p><p>There are several different ways in which you can record system audio and avoid producing screen recordings with terrible sound. Each of the methods includes using third-party apps or screen capturing devices, since Android Lollipop and later versions of the Android OS, still don’t offer an effective solution to this problem.</p><h3 id="1-Use-Mobizen-Screen-Recorder-with-Internal-Audio-App-to-Record-the-internal-audio-on-Android-3"><a href="#1-Use-Mobizen-Screen-Recorder-with-Internal-Audio-App-to-Record-the-internal-audio-on-Android-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Mobizen Screen Recorder with Internal Audio App to Record the internal audio on Android"></a>1. Use Mobizen Screen Recorder with Internal Audio App to Record the internal audio on Android</h3><p>Recently, RSUPPORT company developed the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rsupport.mvagent" >Mobizen Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app that is equipped with all the essential screen recording tools. At the same time, it also allows its users to record only sound produced by their Smartphones during the screen recording session. You can download this app for free on the Google Play store, but if you choose to install it on your Android phone, you should arm yourself with patience since this app contains ads.</p><p>After you’ve successfully installed Mobizen Screen Recorder on your Android Smartphone, you should launch the app and look for the Settings gear icon located in the upper right corner of your screen. Tap on the Sound option, and before proceeding any further, you should make sure that Sound is enabled. Once you allow the Sound feature, you’ll be able to see the Options menu that offers External and Internal features. By selecting the Internal option, you will instruct the app to record only the sound produced by the gameplay of the video game you are recording or a YouTube video you’re playing while the screen recording session is in progress.</p><p>The result you will get is the crystal clear audio in your screen recording, but Mobizen app performs well <strong>only with Samsung and LG Android phones</strong>, so if you have an Android device from some other manufacturer, this app may underperform.</p><h3 id="2-Record-the-internal-audio-from-a-microphone-on-Android-with-the-AZ-Screen-Recorder-3"><a href="#2-Record-the-internal-audio-from-a-microphone-on-Android-with-the-AZ-Screen-Recorder-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Record the internal audio from a microphone on Android with the AZ Screen Recorder"></a>2. Record the internal audio from a microphone on Android with the AZ Screen Recorder</h3><p>If you choose to utilize this method of recording internal audio, make sure that the room where your recording is completely silent since the microphone you will be using can pick up external sounds as well as internal audio.</p><p>You can download the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en" >AZ Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from the Google Play for free. Once the installation is complete, launch the app and tap on the Settings icon. This app won’t record sound until you enable this option, which is the reason why you should locate the Record Audio feature in the Settings menu.</p><p>At this point, you should exit the app, and click on the AZ bubble on the side of your Smartphone’s screen. Tap on the Record icon to start the screen recording session and proceed to perform all actions you wanted to capture with your Android device. The audio will be recorded simultaneously with the video. When ready, slide down the notification bar, and stop the screen recording session.</p><p>In order to extract the audio file, you’ll have to transfer the screen recording you made with AZ Screen Recorder to a PC and perform this action with a video editing software. You may have to create several screen recordings of your Smartphone’s screen before you get the perfect audio because the device’s microphone is going to capture all sound it can pick up, both external and internal.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Record-Android-internal-audio-with-a-capture-card-3"><a href="#Part-2-Record-Android-internal-audio-with-a-capture-card-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Record Android internal audio with a capture card"></a>Part 2: Record Android internal audio with a capture card</h2><p>Capture cards are much more than screen recorders since they mostly serve as a bridge between a PC and the device whose screen you are trying to capture. Professionals often use capture cards, despite their prices, simply because they enable them to record high-quality screen recordings, create live streams, and record internal audio from any device they are connected to, including Android Smartphones.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-capture-card.jpg"                      alt="Record Android games on PC with capture card"                ></p><p>Most capture cards are equipped with their own screen recording software, so the process of adjusting the video and audio settings depends on the capture card you have. If you have an <a class="link"   href="https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/downloads" >Elgato <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Capture Card you can have complete control over the audio recording process by using the Elgato Sound Capture feature. This powerful tool will enable you to mix sounds from multiple sources, select which microphones will be used during a live stream and adjust the music and sound volumes. However, if you want to use the Elgato, you need to make sure that your PC is compatible with this capture card, and you’ll have to connect your Android Smartphone with this device.</p><p>Using capture cards to record a screen on your Smartphone may be too expensive since capture cards are frequently used as a part of the professional gaming equipment used for streaming or capturing gameplay from games on Xbox or PS4.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Record-Android-Internal-Audio-with-Bandicam-and-the-Nox-Emulator-3"><a href="#Part-3-Record-Android-Internal-Audio-with-Bandicam-and-the-Nox-Emulator-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Record Android Internal Audio with Bandicam and the Nox Emulator"></a>Part 3: Record Android Internal Audio with Bandicam and the Nox Emulator</h2><p>Although this may not be the simplest way to record internal audio on your Smartphone device, it is probably the best solution if you want to create high-resolution screen recordings of your Smartphone’s screen and professional internal audio recordings at the same time.</p><p>Before you can start a recording session you must first install <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Bandicam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your PC. This software can be used for the production of high-quality screen recordings of your desktop, and it also offers excellent audio recording options.</p><p>Furthermore, you are going to need an Android emulator, an app that sends the pictures from your Android’s screen to a bigger screen, connected to your Android device. The <a class="link"   href="https://www.bignox.com/" >Nox App Player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will enable you to run the apps you want to record on your PC. There is a recording feature in the NOxPlayer Emulator, while the Bandicam software can be used to capture your desktop activities, as well as the system audio during a screen recording session. So, it is recommended to use both Bandicam and NoxPlayer to record audio in the video from Android phone on PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-android-games-pc-noxplayer.jpg"                      alt="Record Android games on PC"                ></p><p>This method of recording internal audio on an Android device is best used if you want to create high-resolution audio recordings that can later be edited and used in the final cut of the screen recording you produced with Bandicam software and the Nox App Player.</p><p>That’s the way that we figured out about how to record the internal sound on your Android phones and tablets.

Despite Rockstar’s continued tease of GTA 6, most of us have already experienced that world since 2013. We’ve collected a few of our favorite GTA-inspired substitutes for you to enjoy in the meantime. We’ve compiled 10 games like GTA V to keep you occupied until we find out what’s next for the series.</p><h3 id="1-Red-Dead-Redemption-2"><a href="#1-Red-Dead-Redemption-2" class="headerlink" title="1.Red Dead Redemption 2"></a>1.Red Dead Redemption 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/red-dead-redemption-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="red-dead-redemption-2-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p>The same studio makes both the GTA series and Red Dead, so you can probably guess why that one’s here. As with its predecessor, Red Dead Redemption 2 has an open world that feels alive, and it never says away from including interesting details. Following an outlaw gang who hopes to pull one last heist before retiring, it is primarily a story of trust and betrayal. The story is not as simple as it seems, and many unexpected twists and turns are revealed. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a great game if you like GTA 5 with a Wild West theme and revolver weapons. Its setting is reminiscent of GTA’s belief in player freedom. If you’re in the mood for a Grand Theft Auto experience, Red Dead Redemption 2 is well worth your time.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Visuals and voice acting is incredible.</p><p>• Side quests and main missions that will thrill you.</p><p>• Many side distractions that are both ludicrous and delightful.</p><p>• You feel like you have gone back a century.</p><h3 id="2-Assassin’s-Creed-Origins"><a href="#2-Assassin’s-Creed-Origins" class="headerlink" title="2.Assassin’s Creed Origins"></a>2.Assassin’s Creed Origins</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/assassins-creed-origins-poster.jpg"                      alt="assassins-creed-origins-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Microsoft Windows, Google Stadia</p><p>The Assassin’s Creed series has increasingly emphasized open-world gameplay, making it a great choice for GTA 5 fans.

In this regard, Rockstar’s new game straddles a much closer line between contemporary Grand Theft Auto games and its own setting for a biting satire. From Grand Theft Auto 5, do you remember the mission “Life Invaders”? It’s pretty cool to use bungee-corded pool balls as weapons.

In the end, it was a mediocre effort that garnered a cult following for two games but failed to make a lasting impression. Saints Row: The Third, in contrast, took note of how grim and serious games like GTA were becoming, said “f that,” and made them ridiculous.</p><p>You play as a group of friends so widely known and loved that you rob a bank dressed as novelty costumes of yourselves. Players will face a small-scale zombie apocalypse, make various decisions that matter, and fight with a three-foot-long dildo bat as a melee weapon. Many GTA-like games get stuck in their own self-importance, but Saints Row just stays as silly as possible. Although this is an older game, it has backward compatibility on Xbox One and was ported to Nintendo Switch in 2019, so it is a great excuse to revisit the Saints once again.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Activities that are absurd and surreal.</p><p>• Plot twists that will make your head spin.</p><p>• The world has a tremendous amount of depth.</p><p>• Driving and combat models that are simple.</p><h3 id="5-Just-Cause-4"><a href="#5-Just-Cause-4" class="headerlink" title="5.Just Cause 4"></a>5.Just Cause 4</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/just-cause4-poster.jpg"                      alt="just-cause4-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p>You, the player, have a lot of freedom in Just Cause 4, so you can achieve unprecedented levels of chaos. Don’t forget your wingsuit. Your grappling hook is ready. Cars that can be surfed as a massive tornado lifts them into the air. Just wait until you see what you can achieve in The Republic of Medici if the ragdoll physics amused you in GTA 5. In truth, Rockstar’s latest offering lacks the storytelling prowess of its signature franchise but instead excels at choreographing carnage on an epic scale.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• The abilities of Rico are immensely powerful.</p><p>• The setting is beautiful and varied.</p><p>• Extreme weather conditions are the essence of Just Cause.</p><p>• New gadgets can be experimented with on the physics system.</p><h3 id="6-Yakuza-0"><a href="#6-Yakuza-0" class="headerlink" title="6.Yakuza 0"></a>6.Yakuza 0</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/yakuza0-poster.jpg"                      alt="yakuza0-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4</p><p>With so many side activities to enjoy outside of the main campaign, Grand Theft Auto has always been praised for the way it brings cities to life. The design philosophy of Yakuza 0 is taken to its logical conclusion. Yakuza 0 joins the likes of Grand Theft Auto 5 with karaoke, pool, arcade games, wrestling, bowling, dancing, gambling, and… I think awkwardly viewing some explicit material in the back of a video store. Those last two can attest that not all side activities are tastefully done, but the sheer number and variety of options are astonishing. Compared to GTA, Yakuza has a much smaller scope, but what it lacks in quantity (quirky, offbeat) it makes up for in quality.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• It’s so diverse.</p><p>• Funny writing that is snappy and genuinely funny.</p><p>• There are some great sidequests.</p><p>• The storyline and main characters are good.</p><h3 id="7-Sleeping-Dogs"><a href="#7-Sleeping-Dogs" class="headerlink" title="7.Sleeping Dogs"></a>7.Sleeping Dogs</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sleeping-dogs-poster.jpg"                      alt="sleeping-dogs-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One, PS3, Xbox 360</p><p>In keeping with its name, Sleeping Dogs was a sleeper hit in 2012. Combining the action of B-movie stunt movies with the conventions of the open-world crime genre, it becomes a sleeper hit. With its garb of a classic Bruce Lee film, it feels like Grand Theft Auto dressed up as a classic video game. Unfortunately, Sleeping Dogs 2 was canned while still in its early stages of development, making it a rare gem that deserves to be appreciated for what it brought to the table. Sleeping Dogs was re-released in 2014 on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, so there’s really no excuse to let it remain unpurchased (sorry).</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Fights well drives well and runs well.</p><p>• A well-acted and told story.</p><p>• The game features fierce melee combat, an alluring atmosphere, and fun gunplay.</p><p>• You can find a variety of collectibles and enjoy many other diversions.</p><h3 id="8-The-Saboteur"><a href="#8-The-Saboteur" class="headerlink" title="8.The Saboteur"></a>8.The Saboteur</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-saboteur-poster.jpg"                      alt="the-saboteur-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Microsoft Windows, iOS, Xbox 360, BlackBerry, PlayStation 3</p><p>Taking the open-world game experience and tying it to a WWII setting makes The Saboteur a great game. With multiple realistic historical elements, it is set during the German occupation in France. Sean Devlin, an Irish cab driver who joins the resistance after the German soldiers kill his best friend, is the protagonist of The Saboteur.</p><p>Gameplay-wise, The Saboteur and GTA 5 have a lot in common. Both involve running around an open world, stealing cars, causing havoc, and evading the law. Gamers will be entertained for hours with The Saboteur’s interesting open-world gameplay and side-quests.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Action that moves quickly.</p><p>• Filter for black and white graphics.</p><p>• There is a vast world to discover in this game.</p><p>• Excellent sound design and a great story.</p><h3 id="9-Mafia-Definitive-Edition"><a href="#9-Mafia-Definitive-Edition" class="headerlink" title="9.Mafia: Definitive Edition"></a>9.Mafia: Definitive Edition</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mafia-definite-edition-poster.jpg"                      alt="mafia-definite-edition-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Microsoft Windows</p><p>While Mafia: Definitive Edition lacks the open-world concept as much as fans would have liked, its mafia-themed story makes up for it. Mafia’s story is similar to GTA 5’s astonishing storytelling ability. Tommy Angelo is a cab driver who becomes involved in the Mafia after an unfortunate event. Fans are kept on edge by Mafia’s story as they experience unexpected betrayal and heartbreaking forgiveness.</p><p>Additionally, Mafia provides a third-person perspective and multiple weapons within the game, similar to GTA 5. There are a lot of similarities between the Mafia franchise and GTA 5.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• This is an excellent story.</p><p>• The artwork for Lost Heaven is stunning.</p><p>• The original story is enhanced by new voice work and facial captures.</p><p>• The visuals are impressive.</p><h3 id="10-Grand-Theft-Auto-IV"><a href="#10-Grand-Theft-Auto-IV" class="headerlink" title="10.Grand Theft Auto IV"></a>10.Grand Theft Auto IV</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gta4-poster.jpg"                      alt="gta4-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Microsoft Windows</p><p>In the franchise’s history, Grand Theft Auto IV was the first game to have online capabilities. While other Grand Theft Auto games adopted an arcade style of driving, this game focused on realistic driving mechanics. There isn’t nearly as much content as in Grand Theft Auto V’s online, but there is plenty to enjoy. The intriguing story mode in Grand Theft Auto IV focuses on protagonist Niko Bellic.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Gameplay footage can now be captured and shared in Video Editor.</p><p>• A great story driven by characters.</p><p>• Modifications and DLC are promised.</p><p>• Independence FM provides custom in-game music.</p><h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h2><p>So, this was our list of 10 best games like GTA 5. We tried our best to keep those titles in this list that are closely related to GTA 5 and offers similar gameplay experience. Although the dynamics of these games will be different compared to GTA 5, you will enjoy the gameplay.</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p>The same studio makes both the GTA series and Red Dead, so you can probably guess why that one’s here.

Despite Watch Dogs 2’s parody of Silicon Valley, Rockstar’s still packs a punch that Ubisoft’s doesn’t, but anyone who has ever had to watch an Apple conference or a Facebook ad will laugh no end.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• An entertaining and strong mission design.</p><p>• There is a lot to see and do in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>• Hack into any electronic device.</p><p>• The concept is very similar to GTA V but it is more of a tech genre game.</p><h3 id="4-Saints-Row-The-Third-3"><a href="#4-Saints-Row-The-Third-3" class="headerlink" title="4.Saints Row: The Third"></a>4.Saints Row: The Third</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/saintsrow-the-third-poster.png"                      alt="saintsrow-the-third-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, Xbox One, Switch, PS3, Xbox 360</p><p>Initially, Saints Row was an obvious ripoff of GTA, desperately trying to copy Rockstar’s style. In the end, it was a mediocre effort that garnered a cult following for two games but failed to make a lasting impression. Saints Row: The Third, in contrast, took note of how grim and serious games like GTA were becoming, said “f that,” and made them ridiculous.</p><p>You play as a group of friends so widely known and loved that you rob a bank dressed as novelty costumes of yourselves. Players will face a small-scale zombie apocalypse, make various decisions that matter, and fight with a three-foot-long dildo bat as a melee weapon. Many GTA-like games get stuck in their own self-importance, but Saints Row just stays as silly as possible. Although this is an older game, it has backward compatibility on Xbox One and was ported to Nintendo Switch in 2019, so it is a great excuse to revisit the Saints once again.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Activities that are absurd and surreal.</p><p>• Plot twists that will make your head spin.</p><p>• The world has a tremendous amount of depth.</p><p>• Driving and combat models that are simple.</p><h3 id="5-Just-Cause-4-3"><a href="#5-Just-Cause-4-3" class="headerlink" title="5.Just Cause 4"></a>5.Just Cause 4</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/just-cause4-poster.jpg"                      alt="just-cause4-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p>You, the player, have a lot of freedom in Just Cause 4, so you can achieve unprecedented levels of chaos. Don’t forget your wingsuit. Your grappling hook is ready. Cars that can be surfed as a massive tornado lifts them into the air. Just wait until you see what you can achieve in The Republic of Medici if the ragdoll physics amused you in GTA 5. In truth, Rockstar’s latest offering lacks the storytelling prowess of its signature franchise but instead excels at choreographing carnage on an epic scale.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• The abilities of Rico are immensely powerful.</p><p>• The setting is beautiful and varied.</p><p>• Extreme weather conditions are the essence of Just Cause.</p><p>• New gadgets can be experimented with on the physics system.</p><h3 id="6-Yakuza-0-3"><a href="#6-Yakuza-0-3" class="headerlink" title="6.Yakuza 0"></a>6.Yakuza 0</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/yakuza0-poster.jpg"                      alt="yakuza0-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4</p><p>With so many side activities to enjoy outside of the main campaign, Grand Theft Auto has always been praised for the way it brings cities to life. The design philosophy of Yakuza 0 is taken to its logical conclusion. Yakuza 0 joins the likes of Grand Theft Auto 5 with karaoke, pool, arcade games, wrestling, bowling, dancing, gambling, and… I think awkwardly viewing some explicit material in the back of a video store. Those last two can attest that not all side activities are tastefully done, but the sheer number and variety of options are astonishing. Compared to GTA, Yakuza has a much smaller scope, but what it lacks in quantity (quirky, offbeat) it makes up for in quality.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• It’s so diverse.</p><p>• Funny writing that is snappy and genuinely funny.</p><p>• There are some great sidequests.</p><p>• The storyline and main characters are good.</p><h3 id="7-Sleeping-Dogs-3"><a href="#7-Sleeping-Dogs-3" class="headerlink" title="7.Sleeping Dogs"></a>7.Sleeping Dogs</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sleeping-dogs-poster.jpg"                      alt="sleeping-dogs-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One, PS3, Xbox 360</p><p>In keeping with its name, Sleeping Dogs was a sleeper hit in 2012. Combining the action of B-movie stunt movies with the conventions of the open-world crime genre, it becomes a sleeper hit. With its garb of a classic Bruce Lee film, it feels like Grand Theft Auto dressed up as a classic video game. Unfortunately, Sleeping Dogs 2 was canned while still in its early stages of development, making it a rare gem that deserves to be appreciated for what it brought to the table. Sleeping Dogs was re-released in 2014 on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, so there’s really no excuse to let it remain unpurchased (sorry).</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Fights well drives well and runs well.</p><p>• A well-acted and told story.</p><p>• The game features fierce melee combat, an alluring atmosphere, and fun gunplay.</p><p>• You can find a variety of collectibles and enjoy many other diversions.</p><h3 id="8-The-Saboteur-3"><a href="#8-The-Saboteur-3" class="headerlink" title="8.The Saboteur"></a>8.The Saboteur</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-saboteur-poster.jpg"                      alt="the-saboteur-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Microsoft Windows, iOS, Xbox 360, BlackBerry, PlayStation 3</p><p>Taking the open-world game experience and tying it to a WWII setting makes The Saboteur a great game. With multiple realistic historical elements, it is set during the German occupation in France. Sean Devlin, an Irish cab driver who joins the resistance after the German soldiers kill his best friend, is the protagonist of The Saboteur.</p><p>Gameplay-wise, The Saboteur and GTA 5 have a lot in common. Both involve running around an open world, stealing cars, causing havoc, and evading the law. Gamers will be entertained for hours with The Saboteur’s interesting open-world gameplay and side-quests.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Action that moves quickly.</p><p>• Filter for black and white graphics.</p><p>• There is a vast world to discover in this game.</p><p>• Excellent sound design and a great story.</p><h3 id="9-Mafia-Definitive-Edition-3"><a href="#9-Mafia-Definitive-Edition-3" class="headerlink" title="9.Mafia: Definitive Edition"></a>9.Mafia: Definitive Edition</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mafia-definite-edition-poster.jpg"                      alt="mafia-definite-edition-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Microsoft Windows</p><p>While Mafia: Definitive Edition lacks the open-world concept as much as fans would have liked, its mafia-themed story makes up for it. Mafia’s story is similar to GTA 5’s astonishing storytelling ability. Tommy Angelo is a cab driver who becomes involved in the Mafia after an unfortunate event. Fans are kept on edge by Mafia’s story as they experience unexpected betrayal and heartbreaking forgiveness.</p><p>Additionally, Mafia provides a third-person perspective and multiple weapons within the game, similar to GTA 5. There are a lot of similarities between the Mafia franchise and GTA 5.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• This is an excellent story.</p><p>• The artwork for Lost Heaven is stunning.</p><p>• The original story is enhanced by new voice work and facial captures.</p><p>• The visuals are impressive.</p><h3 id="10-Grand-Theft-Auto-IV-3"><a href="#10-Grand-Theft-Auto-IV-3" class="headerlink" title="10.Grand Theft Auto IV"></a>10.Grand Theft Auto IV</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gta4-poster.jpg"                      alt="gta4-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Microsoft Windows</p><p>In the franchise’s history, Grand Theft Auto IV was the first game to have online capabilities. While other Grand Theft Auto games adopted an arcade style of driving, this game focused on realistic driving mechanics. There isn’t nearly as much content as in Grand Theft Auto V’s online, but there is plenty to enjoy. The intriguing story mode in Grand Theft Auto IV focuses on protagonist Niko Bellic.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Gameplay footage can now be captured and shared in Video Editor.</p><p>• A great story driven by characters.</p><p>• Modifications and DLC are promised.</p><p>• Independence FM provides custom in-game music.</p><h2 id="Final-Verdict-3"><a href="#Final-Verdict-3" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h2><p>So, this was our list of 10 best games like GTA 5.

What is the best Zoom alternative for musicians?"></a>3. What is the best Zoom alternative for musicians?</h4><p>Musicians cannot compromise on video and audio quality during their music recordings. Plus, they also freak out when video lags or jitters. So, they prefer applications with minimal noise distortion and robust mechanisms to deal with background noise. LANDR, Discord, and Reapers are the few <strong>Zoom alternatives</strong> for musicians</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The contribution of Zoom to changing the digital landscape cannot be denied. The outbreak of Covid-19 has also led to a surge in the use of video-conferencing applications, especially Zoom. However, this does not mean that Zoom will fit all requirements. If you are bored of Zoom’s interface or want to host meetings for more than 40 minutes, switching <strong>to Zoom alternatives</strong> is not a bad thing. The above-mentioned video communication platforms will help you make a choice if you are looking for other options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-computer-as-your-personal-tv-videographer/"><u>2024 Approved  Computer as Your Personal TV Videographer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-strategies-to-eliminate-frames-loss-in-obs-recordings/"><u>[Updated] Strategies to Eliminate Frames Loss in OBS Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-live-gaming-shows-set-up-with-obs/"><u>[New] In 2024, Live Gaming Shows  Set Up with OBS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-alternate-escapades-where-the-gta-v-lives-are-missing/"><u>[New] In 2024, Alternate Escapades -

In addition, multiple speakers cannot speak at the same time during a meeting, which is why it is better to create a separate space where different team members can talk without interruption.</p><p>Zoom application offers a perfect solution to this problem by enabling participants <strong>to join breakout rooms</strong> where they can discuss particular tasks in private.</p><p>You are at the right place if you are just getting started with Zoom. Because in this tutorial we are going to show you how to use Zoom breakout rooms during meetings you host on this app.</p><ul><li><a href="#what_is_breakout_room">Part 1: What is a Breakout Room in Zoom?</a></li><li><a href="#create_zoom_breakout_room">Part 2: How to Create a Breakout Room?</a></li><li><a href="#manage_zoom_breakout_rooom">Part 3: How to Manage Breakout Rooms?</a></li><li><a href="#record_breakout_room">Part 4: How to Record Breakout Rooms meetings?</a></li><li><a href="#zoom-breakout-room_faq">Part 5: Troubleshooting Zoom Breakout Rooms</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-Breakout-Room-in-Zoom"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-Breakout-Room-in-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is a Breakout Room in Zoom?"></a>Part 1: What is a Breakout Room in Zoom?</h2><p>A breakout room is a sub-room that can be created during a meeting and you can split a meeting into up to 50 breakout sessions. The app allows you to choose if you want to create these sub-rooms and split the participants in a meeting into smaller groups automatically or manually.</p><p>You must purchase the Large Meeting add-on if you would like to create 50 breakout sessions that have as many as two hundred participants. Each participant in a breakout session has complete control over video, audio and screen sharing options, and they can record each breakroom locally. In case the meeting’s host has enabled the cloud recording feature, Zoom will only record the main room while giving the participants the option to record the breakout room separately.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Create-a-Breakout-Room"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Create-a-Breakout-Room" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Create a Breakout Room?"></a>Part 2: How to Create a Breakout Room?</h2><h3 id="1-Enable-Breakout-Rooms-in-Zoom"><a href="#1-Enable-Breakout-Rooms-in-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="1. Enable Breakout Rooms in Zoom"></a>1. Enable Breakout Rooms in Zoom</h3><p>Creating a breakout room requires you to install the Zoom desktop client and to create an account on Zoom. Once you complete these two steps, you should sign in to your account and choose the Account Settings option from the Account Management menu. Locate the Breakout Room feature that is located in the Meeting tab and if the feature is disabled you should click on it to toggle it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/eable-breakout-room-zoom.jpg"                      alt=" Enable Breakout Rooms in Zoom"                ></p><p>Hosts who would like to assign participants to breakout rooms while scheduling a meeting should click on the Allow host to assign participants to breakout rooms when scheduling a checkbox. Clicking on the Lock icon will make the breakout room setting mandatory for all users on your Zoom account.</p><p>Besides using the breakout rooms during meetings, you can also enable them in different groups you create. Head over to the User Management menu, click on the Group Management option and then select the group in which you would like to enable breakout rooms.</p><p>Click on the Settings tab, navigate to the Meetings tab and click on the Breakout Room feature. You can then proceed to enable this option the same way you would enable it if you were setting up a regular Zoom meeting.</p><p>Zoom also allows account administrators and account members to activate the breakout room feature. You should click on the Settings option if you are accessing a Zoom account as an account member or go to the Account Management and pick the Account Settings option if you are accessing a Zoom account as an account administrator.</p><p>Afterward, you should just enable the breakout room option from the Meetings tab and decide if you want to pre-assign members to particular rooms while scheduling a meeting.</p><h3 id="2-Create-Breakout-Rooms-in-Zoom-Meeting"><a href="#2-Create-Breakout-Rooms-in-Zoom-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="2.

Optionally, you can also activate a countdown after a breakout room is closed and specify its duration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/manage-breakout-rooms-zoom.jpg"                      alt=" Manage  Breakout Rooms in Zoom"                ></p><p>Click on the Open all Rooms button to start assigning participants to different breakout rooms. You should then click on the Assign button next to a particular room and select all the participants you wish to add to that room. Keep in mind that the Assign button will be replaced with the number of participants each room has as soon as you add the first participant to them.</p><p>Zoom also allows you to move participants from one room to another after you assigned them to one of the breakout rooms you created.

In addition, multiple speakers cannot speak at the same time during a meeting, which is why it is better to create a separate space where different team members can talk without interruption.</p><p>Zoom application offers a perfect solution to this problem by enabling participants <strong>to join breakout rooms</strong> where they can discuss particular tasks in private.</p><p>You are at the right place if you are just getting started with Zoom. Because in this tutorial we are going to show you how to use Zoom breakout rooms during meetings you host on this app.</p><ul><li><a href="#what_is_breakout_room">Part 1: What is a Breakout Room in Zoom?</a></li><li><a href="#create_zoom_breakout_room">Part 2: How to Create a Breakout Room?</a></li><li><a href="#manage_zoom_breakout_rooom">Part 3: How to Manage Breakout Rooms?</a></li><li><a href="#record_breakout_room">Part 4: How to Record Breakout Rooms meetings?</a></li><li><a href="#zoom-breakout-room_faq">Part 5: Troubleshooting Zoom Breakout Rooms</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-Breakout-Room-in-Zoom-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-Breakout-Room-in-Zoom-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is a Breakout Room in Zoom?"></a>Part 1: What is a Breakout Room in Zoom?</h2><p>A breakout room is a sub-room that can be created during a meeting and you can split a meeting into up to 50 breakout sessions. The app allows you to choose if you want to create these sub-rooms and split the participants in a meeting into smaller groups automatically or manually.</p><p>You must purchase the Large Meeting add-on if you would like to create 50 breakout sessions that have as many as two hundred participants. Each participant in a breakout session has complete control over video, audio and screen sharing options, and they can record each breakroom locally. In case the meeting’s host has enabled the cloud recording feature, Zoom will only record the main room while giving the participants the option to record the breakout room separately.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Create-a-Breakout-Room-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Create-a-Breakout-Room-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Create a Breakout Room?"></a>Part 2: How to Create a Breakout Room?</h2><h3 id="1-Enable-Breakout-Rooms-in-Zoom-3"><a href="#1-Enable-Breakout-Rooms-in-Zoom-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Enable Breakout Rooms in Zoom"></a>1. Enable Breakout Rooms in Zoom</h3><p>Creating a breakout room requires you to install the Zoom desktop client and to create an account on Zoom. Once you complete these two steps, you should sign in to your account and choose the Account Settings option from the Account Management menu. Locate the Breakout Room feature that is located in the Meeting tab and if the feature is disabled you should click on it to toggle it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/eable-breakout-room-zoom.jpg"                      alt=" Enable Breakout Rooms in Zoom"                ></p><p>Hosts who would like to assign participants to breakout rooms while scheduling a meeting should click on the Allow host to assign participants to breakout rooms when scheduling a checkbox. Clicking on the Lock icon will make the breakout room setting mandatory for all users on your Zoom account.</p><p>Besides using the breakout rooms during meetings, you can also enable them in different groups you create. Head over to the User Management menu, click on the Group Management option and then select the group in which you would like to enable breakout rooms.</p><p>Click on the Settings tab, navigate to the Meetings tab and click on the Breakout Room feature. You can then proceed to enable this option the same way you would enable it if you were setting up a regular Zoom meeting.</p><p>Zoom also allows account administrators and account members to activate the breakout room feature. You should click on the Settings option if you are accessing a Zoom account as an account member or go to the Account Management and pick the Account Settings option if you are accessing a Zoom account as an account administrator.</p><p>Afterward, you should just enable the breakout room option from the Meetings tab and decide if you want to pre-assign members to particular rooms while scheduling a meeting.</p><h3 id="2-Create-Breakout-Rooms-in-Zoom-Meeting-3"><a href="#2-Create-Breakout-Rooms-in-Zoom-Meeting-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Create Breakout Rooms in Zoom Meeting"></a>2. Create Breakout Rooms in Zoom Meeting</h3><p>Once the breakout room feature is enabled, you should start a new meeting and click on the Breakout Room icon in the Zoom’s toolbar. You will be prompted to set the number of rooms you would like to create for the meeting and choose if you want to assign participants to breakout rooms automatically or manually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-breakout-rooms.jpg"                      alt=" Create  Breakout Rooms in Zoom"                ></p><p>Click on the Create Rooms button to complete the process and proceed to fine-tune the settings for each room.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Manage-Breakout-Rooms-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Manage-Breakout-Rooms-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Manage Breakout Rooms"></a>Part 3: How to Manage Breakout Rooms</h2><p>Zoom offers several options that make managing breakout rooms easier, so after you create breakout rooms for a meeting you should click on the Options icon.</p><p>You can then decide if you want to move all participants into breakout rooms automatically, allow participants to return to the main session at any time or set the timeframe after which all breakout rooms are going to close. Optionally, you can also activate a countdown after a breakout room is closed and specify its duration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/manage-breakout-rooms-zoom.jpg"                      alt=" Manage  Breakout Rooms in Zoom"                ></p><p>Click on the Open all Rooms button to start assigning participants to different breakout rooms. You should then click on the Assign button next to a particular room and select all the participants you wish to add to that room. Keep in mind that the Assign button will be replaced with the number of participants each room has as soon as you add the first participant to them.</p><p>Zoom also allows you to move participants from one room to another after you assigned them to one of the breakout rooms you created. You will be able to see Move and Exchange options next to the names of all participants you added to a room. Click on the Move option if you want to move a participant from one room to another or click on the Exchange option if you want to switch places of two participants who were added to different rooms. In addition, you can delete all breakout rooms you created and make new ones by clicking on the Recreate button or delete a room you selected.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Recording-Zoom-Breakout-Rooms-3"><a href="#Part-4-Recording-Zoom-Breakout-Rooms-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Recording Zoom Breakout Rooms"></a>Part 4: Recording Zoom Breakout Rooms</h2><p>The participants who join a breakout room will have several options at their disposal, so that they can mute&#x2F;unmute other participants, start or stop a video, see the full list of participants, share their screens, chat or record a breakout session.</p><p>Participants cannot start recording a breakout room until they are granted permission by the host. Ideally, hosts should enable this option before opening the rooms, although they can grant permission to record by entering a room and enabling the Local Recording option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/allow-record-zoom-meeting.jpg"                      alt=" Record  Breakout Rooms in Zoom"                ></p><p>Afterward, you just have to click on the Record button and the activities within your breakout room will be recorded. Zoom allows you to pause or stop a recording at any moment and you should just click on the corresponding button in the meeting toolbar to perform this action.</p><p>Keep in mind that you may lose the video you’re recording if the recording process is interrupted in any other way other than clicking on the Stop or Pause buttons.</p><p>We’ve written an article about Zoom meeting, if you’ve met any questions about it, you can check it here: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Record Zoom Meeting Guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Troubleshooting-Zoom-Breakout-Rooms-3"><a href="#Part-5-Troubleshooting-Zoom-Breakout-Rooms-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Troubleshooting Zoom Breakout Rooms"></a>Part 5: Troubleshooting Zoom Breakout Rooms</h2><p>Even though creating and managing breakout rooms shouldn’t be too difficult, you may still experience problems.
