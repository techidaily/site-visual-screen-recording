    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Strategic-Showdowns-Unleashed-Exploring-7-Best-Games"><a href="#Strategic-Showdowns-Unleashed-Exploring-7-Best-Games" class="headerlink" title="Strategic Showdowns Unleashed: Exploring 7 Best Games"></a>Strategic Showdowns Unleashed: Exploring 7 Best Games</h2><p>It’s a tough task to choose the best total war games. Everyone has a favorite—the game that first introduced them to the series or allowed them to immerse themselves in a historical era they’d always been fascinated with. When you find a historical era you didn’t even know much about, as I did through Shogun 2 &amp; Three Kingdoms, it sparks your interest.</p><p>Warhammer 3 introduces survival combat, a fresh Three Kingdoms game is announced, Saga: Troy tries mythology on it for size, the franchise is expanding in more ways than ever before. Classics, though, are still available. One of the most compelling aspects is that, despite their differences, they all have a sense of cohesiveness. You can dive into anything and always find something in common.</p><p>For many individuals, Total War has a special place in their hearts, and it’s always enjoyable to go back and play games from the series whenever the mood strikes. I’m constantly attracted back to films like Attila, Fall of the Samurai, and Rome 2, to name a few. Regardless of whatever one you favor, they all provide a similar combination of struggle and failure, conquest, and dominance.</p><p>The Best Total War games on their own are listed here.</p><h3 id="1-Attila-the-Hun"><a href="#1-Attila-the-Hun" class="headerlink" title="1.Attila the Hun"></a>1.Attila the Hun</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/attila-the-hun-poster.png"                      alt="attila-the-hun-poster"                ></p><p>Napoleon aspired to be Attila the Hun. At the time of its release, Attila’s primary goal was to fix Rome 2’s flaws and stripped-down features, since it seemed like the game was going down the same road as Empire. Attila, on the other hand, proved to be more than that, because it not only reintroduced promised features but also innovated, iterated, and expanded the brand.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Dramatic perspective.</p><p>• Ominous franchise.</p><h3 id="2-Rome-2-Total-War"><a href="#2-Rome-2-Total-War" class="headerlink" title="2.Rome 2 Total War"></a>2.Rome 2 Total War</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rome-2-total-war-poster.png"                      alt="rome-2-total-war-poster"                ></p><p>Unlike its predecessor, Rome 2, which was released in 2004, the time has been very kind with Rome 2 &amp;, as a consequence, it may be called a surprise success for CA. Rome 2 had a disastrous debut, similar to Empire, and it took a year for it to become genuinely playable. CA, on the other hand, stuck it out and won their first genuine AAA Total War.</p><p>Apart from the largely forgotten rough launch problems and many contentious design choices, Rome 2 has left an unresolved black stain on the Total War series that still exists today: chronic feature stripping, particularly in multiplayer. Regardless, Rome 2 is a fascinating revisit to Ancient Rome, though it took a long time to get there—after all, Rome was not built in a day.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Gore &amp; Blood.</p><p>• State of Greek culture pack.</p><p>• Raider and Pirates culture pack.</p><h3 id="3-Three-Kingdoms-Total-War"><a href="#3-Three-Kingdoms-Total-War" class="headerlink" title="3.Three Kingdoms: Total War"></a>3.Three Kingdoms: Total War</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/three-kingdom-total-war-poster.jpg"                      alt="three-kingdom-total-war-poster"                ></p><p>Three Kingdoms has been the most recent mainline of the best total war games, and in my opinion, it’s also the most honest. The game devotes itself entirely to a dramatized, idealized, and cinematic depiction in Ancient Chinese history (the first in the series), relying mainly on the Love rather than the Three Kingdoms Records. I wouldn’t be shocked if the upcoming best total war games took a more hands-on approach.</p><p>However, there are several flaws with it. Unfortunately, the tactical layer continues to be hampered by the simpler Thrones of Brittania’s financial and building system, and the campaign is poorly paced owing to the campaign map’s sheer vastness and stretched-out primary goals. The most serious problem is the absence of multiplayer service and support. Even though here is where CA may locate gold, it was almost dead when it arrived. Three Kingdoms is, in the end, a sprawling, rich, and thrilling retelling of a violent era in Chinese history.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Focused on character.</p><p>• Story and setting.</p><p>• Diplomacy.</p><h3 id="4-Total-War-Saga-Samurai-Fall"><a href="#4-Total-War-Saga-Samurai-Fall" class="headerlink" title="4.Total War Saga: Samurai Fall"></a>4.Total War Saga: Samurai Fall</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/total-war-saga-samurai-fall.jpg"                      alt="total-war-saga-samurai-fall"                ></p><p>Ironically, the greatest Saga game was never intended to be a Saga game. Fall of the Samurai (later renamed as a Saga game) was released as a standalone addition for Shogun 2, transporting players to the lesser-known Meiji Restoration era in Japanese history, when pro-Imperial and pro-Shogunate armies fought for Japan’s destiny.</p><p>As close-quarters oriented samurai fight against and besides modern firearms-equipped soldiers, the campaign’s theme of tradition vs. modernity creates intriguing combat dynamics. This gives the tactical gameplay a fascinating twist and complexity that matches Shogun 2’s meticulous balance. The fall of the Samurai is certainly worth checking out as a historical development and improvement of Shogun 2.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Dramatic Clash.</p><p>• Modern weaponry.</p><p>• Explosive power.</p><h3 id="5-Warhammer-2"><a href="#5-Warhammer-2" class="headerlink" title="5.Warhammer 2"></a>5.Warhammer 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warhammer2-poster.jpg"                      alt="warhammer2-poster"                ></p><p>With a stronger narrative emphasis and more engaging factions and systems, Warhammer 2 builds on the original’s legacy and influence of the best total war games series.</p><p>Warhammer 2 has all of the features that made Warhammer so popular, as well as tweaks to the balance and additional post-release material and updates. The Mortal Empires’ adventure, which merges the strategic landscapes from the first and two seasons into one huge super campaign, is perhaps Warhammer 2’s most significant feature. However, as a result of this, Warhammer 2 swallows the first, rendering Warhammer insignificant as a gaming experience.</p><p>This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for any Warhammer enthusiast. What’s also cool to see, particularly in the post-launch support, is that both CA &amp; Games Workshop put out the effort to create new components, whether they’re units, heroes, or mythology, and add them to the games, indicating a real interest in using this framework for franchise development. The multiplayer in Warhammer 2 is also very strong, although this is due more to a large number of generally well-defined and realized factions and races than to any specific improvements in the mode.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Real time tactics.</p><p>• Strategy based.</p><p>• AI controlled factions.</p><h3 id="6-Total-War-Medieval-2"><a href="#6-Total-War-Medieval-2" class="headerlink" title="6.Total War Medieval 2"></a>6.Total War Medieval 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/total-war-medieval-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="total-war-medieval-2-poster"                ></p><p>These last two entries are almost interchangeable since they are both excellent examples of best total war games, but because this is a ranking list, I’ll offer a specific response. Medieval 2 is essentially the same game as Medieval 1, but with improved visuals, updated gameplay, and additional features. Who’d have guessed that would suffice?</p><p>Of course, Medieval 2 has many of the same flaws as Rome, such as bad AI and pathfinding, but because there was no remake, it remains a game set in its period that is still remarkable even when compared with some of the most recent best total war games.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Campaign mode.</p><p>• Battle focused.</p><h3 id="7-Shogun-2-Total-War"><a href="#7-Shogun-2-Total-War" class="headerlink" title="7.Shogun 2: Total War"></a>7.Shogun 2: Total War</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shogun2-total-war-poster.jpg"                      alt="shogun2-total-war-poster"                ></p><p>Finally, the apex of Total War, the meeting point and turning point among older and newer era Total Wars, and the example of Creative Assemblies at its height. While Shogun 2 isn’t exactly a AAA cost game (I’d call it an AA or AA.5), it has the feel of one. Even though Shogun 2 lacks some of the previous games’ large landscapes or faction variety, the general performance of the gameplay and features that interact with one another, as well as several quality-of-life improvements, making it the finest game within the list of best total war games.</p><p>The inclusion of the Avatar Invasion multiplayer mode was Shogun 2’s biggest success, but it was not as busy or famous as that at launch. The game’s already high quality in the tactical campaign and battles, coupled with a genuinely unique multiplayer structure, demonstrate that there is a happy medium between keeping what works and introducing something new. Total Wars in the modern era have failed to achieve the same heights as Shogun 2. This game is recommended not only as a fantastic Total War game, but as a fantastic strategy game that will go down in history.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Chosokabe Clan.</p><p>• Army lead.</p><p>• Even beginners can benefit from these tutorials.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/image/box/filmora-9.png"                                     ></p><p>Napoleon aspired to be Attila the Hun.

The Mortal Empires’ adventure, which merges the strategic landscapes from the first and two seasons into one huge super campaign, is perhaps Warhammer 2’s most significant feature. However, as a result of this, Warhammer 2 swallows the first, rendering Warhammer insignificant as a gaming experience.</p><p>This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for any Warhammer enthusiast. What’s also cool to see, particularly in the post-launch support, is that both CA &amp; Games Workshop put out the effort to create new components, whether they’re units, heroes, or mythology, and add them to the games, indicating a real interest in using this framework for franchise development. The multiplayer in Warhammer 2 is also very strong, although this is due more to a large number of generally well-defined and realized factions and races than to any specific improvements in the mode.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Real time tactics.</p><p>• Strategy based.</p><p>• AI controlled factions.</p><h3 id="6-Total-War-Medieval-2-2"><a href="#6-Total-War-Medieval-2-2" class="headerlink" title="6.Total War Medieval 2"></a>6.Total War Medieval 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/total-war-medieval-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="total-war-medieval-2-poster"                ></p><p>These last two entries are almost interchangeable since they are both excellent examples of best total war games, but because this is a ranking list, I’ll offer a specific response.

Even though Shogun 2 lacks some of the previous games’ large landscapes or faction variety, the general performance of the gameplay and features that interact with one another, as well as several quality-of-life improvements, making it the finest game within the list of best total war games.</p><p>The inclusion of the Avatar Invasion multiplayer mode was Shogun 2’s biggest success, but it was not as busy or famous as that at launch. The game’s already high quality in the tactical campaign and battles, coupled with a genuinely unique multiplayer structure, demonstrate that there is a happy medium between keeping what works and introducing something new. Total Wars in the modern era have failed to achieve the same heights as Shogun 2.

Using OBS game capture, you may record screen games for YouTube videos or share snippets of gameplay with your friends for free. With this article, we’ll cover how to record in OBS and how much storage space you’ll need for your recordings. With OBS, it’s easy to keep track of high scores, great in-game performances, and even tips on how to play like a pro quickly and effectively. Since gamers may use several third-party screen-recording techniques when recording their games, learning how to record gameplay using OBS is an ideal solution. An open-source tool called OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) will be utilized in this lesson.</p><p>It is widely utilized by both large and small broadcasters throughout the world because of its reliability as a streaming solution. Despite this, it’s an effective tool for capturing images. OBS Studio enables you to record video directly to your device instead of broadcasting your screen. The days of framed screenshots and complex settings are over. Video game streamers and teachers with a lot of video presentations are likely to be acquainted with the OBS Studio. However, due to the complex user interface, it’s a little tough for beginners to utilize. The good news is that there are a variety of OBS options to pick from. When it comes to performance, it’s on par with other, more costly options. For the most part, the program allows for live streaming to several sites, such as Facebook Live and Hitbox.</p><h2 id="1-Download-and-Install-OBS-on-Mac"><a href="#1-Download-and-Install-OBS-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="1. Download and Install OBS on Mac"></a>1. Download and Install OBS on Mac</h2><p>OBS is an open-source screen recorder and live streamer that is free to use. It’s now available on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. It’s a popular choice among more seasoned customers because of the large variety of options available in the product.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Go to the OBS Website</strong></p><p>Go to the OBS download page using your choice browser and save the installation file to your computer’s hard drive.<br>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://obsproject.com/download" >OBS Website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Step 2: Get the Most Recent Version of the Software</strong></p><p>You may get the most recent version of OBS for Mac by clicking the button on the OBS website.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Download and Install the Software for Mac</strong></p><p>Open the package after downloading it. Drag the OBS icon to the Applications folder when the installer has been opened.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-and-install.jpg"                      alt="download video from funimate"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Get Started!</strong></p><p>Open OBS for the first time by going to the Applications folder and double-clicking on it. Selected ‘Continue’ will bring up a Welcome Screen for the Installer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-started.jpg"                      alt="get-started"                ></p><h2 id="2-Best-OBS-Settings-for-Mac"><a href="#2-Best-OBS-Settings-for-Mac" class="headerlink" title="2. Best OBS Settings for Mac"></a>2. Best OBS Settings for Mac</h2><p>OBS Studio is a complex software that comes with pre-installed screencasting capabilities. Free software often lacks the breadth of features required for flawless broadcasting, but not with OSB Studio. Even though the program is free, it features all of the crucial components that characterize online broadcasting. Many additional parts and modules will be given by the software now and then. That suggests it’s really necessary to dabble and refresh with it. Else, you can experience a few hassles in using OBS correctly.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Launch and Create Output Recorder Setup</strong></p><p>Add on the Plus symbol and create the project. If you want to activate audio monitoring in OBS Studio: Right-click in the Output box, Open the Output mode or you can also go for Advanced Audio Properties:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/output-recorder-setup.jpg"                      alt="output recorder setup"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Customize Record Only Feature</strong></p><p>In OBS for Mac, this setting will deliver the sound of the source to the Desktop as it were. Work area sound should be enabled for the sound to be captured. As soon as you activate this option, navigate towards the recording interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-record.jpg"                      alt="customize record"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Set the Screen and Output Mode</strong></p><p>In OBS Studio for Mac, this setting will broadcast the sound of the source to the stream and Desktop sound separately. This takes into mind individual sound control. To do so, go to the bottom right corner of your screen and pick “settings.” Then, under “recording path,” select the “output” option to specify the spot on your computer where you desire to keep the recordings. Right after that, press the Record button to start recording your Game Audio in parallel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/output-mode.jpg"                      alt="output mode"                ></p><h2 id="3-How-to-Record-Screen-with-OBS-on-Mac"><a href="#3-How-to-Record-Screen-with-OBS-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="3. How to Record Screen with OBS on Mac"></a>3. How to Record Screen with OBS on Mac</h2><p>OBS Studio is open-source, free software that is worth a try for all users. This strategy may be used to solve the problem if you have two graphics cards, one of which is NVIDIA. The OBS black screen is most likely caused by OBS and the game you desire to record running on different graphics cards in this situation. The image of the game can’t be acquired as they’re on separate adapters, and it’s not available on the device OBS is utilizing.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Install and Launch OBS</strong></p><p>To purchase OBS Studio, go to the OBS Project’s official website and join up for their download portal. OBS is available for download and installation. After that, determine whether you want to use Windows, macOS, or Linux. Click the “Windows” download option on the left to acquire OBS for Windows. After clicking it, the download for OBS Studio will begin and the user will be able to locate it on their computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-and-launch.jpg"                      alt="install and launch"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Add Scenes for Recording</strong></p><p>OBS Studio will be available on their PC when the installation is complete, and players may use it to record their Valorous games. The software, on the other hand, does not come pre-configured for recording and must be set up manually. Scenes should be added. Open OBS and go to the bottom left of the screen to the “+” icon below “scenes.” Add a “recording” scenario to the mix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-scenes.jpg"                      alt="add scenes"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Customize the Recording</strong></p><p>Users should go to the Output tab and set the Video Bitrate to 6000 Kbps, Encoder to Hardware, and Audio Bitrate to 256 after entering the settings. Users may also adjust the location of their recording by choosing the save path location in the same settings tab., in the “recording” scene, click the “+” sign below “sources” on the bottom left of the screen, and add a “display capture.” If you have more than one monitor, specify which one you wish to record.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/output-tab.jpg"                      alt="output tab"                ></p><p>You may add a “Video Capture Device” to capture your webcam and an “Audio Input Capture” to gather the sounds from your microphone if you wish to. The next step is for users to go to the Audio tab and deactivate Desktop Audio. Users may add an audio input device, such as a microphone, by setting the Mic&#x2F;Auxiliary device under the same tab.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Setup the Recording</strong></p><p>Now, in the bottom left corner of the screen, click the “Scene” button, and then tap the Add icon next to the scene tab under the sources tab. A drop-down menu will display after selecting the add button, enabling you to add Game Capture and Audio Output Capture. Two more tabs will appear under the sources tab, which must be set. Choose a shooting location as well as a video type. Finally, pick “recording format” and “mp4” (or any other file type) from the drop-down menu. In the “Best Parameters for OBS Recordings,” we’ll go over various additional variables that need to be modified to ensure high-quality outputs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-the-recording.jpg"                      alt="setup the recording"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5: Start&#x2F;Stop Recording</strong></p><p>Users may start recording their gameplay by hitting the “Start Recording” button on the bottom-right of OBS Studio when everything is set up. To stop recording, simply press the Stop Recording button, and the video will be saved at the previously set location. Now is the moment to hit the “start recording” button.</p><h2 id="4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-on-Mac"><a href="#4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="4.

Hence, we recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best alternative to SplitCam.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-unmatched-12-standalone-capture-software-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unmatched 12 Standalone Capture Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-best-virtual-race-games-roundup-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Best Virtual Race Games Roundup for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-premium-top-11-list-audio-recording-essentials-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Premium Top 11 List - Audio Recording Essentials for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-undercover-audio-gems-top-6-non-public-mobile-voice-capturers/"><u>2024 Approved  Undercover Audio Gems  Top 6 Non-Public Mobile Voice Capturers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-from-recordings-to-live-an-obs-guide-to-youtube-and-twitch-streaming/"><u>[New] From Recordings to Live  An OBS Guide to YouTube and Twitch Streaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-premium-top-5-storage-solutions-for-xbox-for-2024/"><u>[New] Premium Top 5 Storage Solutions for Xbox for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-premier-screenshots-software-for-linux-users/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Premier Screenshots Software for Linux Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/fast-fixes-effortless-screenshots-and-captures-with-dell-for-2024/"><u>Fast Fixes  Effortless Screenshots & Captures with Dell for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-laptop-dvd-playback-hacks-top-free-tools/"><u>[New] Laptop DVD Playback Hacks  Top Free Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-innovative-tools-top-cell-phones-for-creatives/"><u>[New] Innovative Tools  Top Cell Phones for Creatives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-how-to-un-refresh-and-restore-your-tiktok-videos/"><u>[New] How to Un-Refresh and Restore Your TikTok Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-the-seamless-way-to-capture-your-favorite-pc-games-6-methods/"><u>[Updated] The Seamless Way to Capture Your Favorite PC Games (6 Methods)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/how-to-get-and-use-pokemon-go-promo-codes-on-realme-c33-2023-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Get and Use Pokemon Go Promo Codes On Realme C33 2023 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/can-life360-track-or-see-text-messages-what-can-you-do-with-life360-on-xiaomi-redmi-note-13-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Can Life360 Track Or See Text Messages?

Apart from playing offline videos, VLC Media Player lets you stream videos from online sources as well as convert videos into different file formats. Besides, there are graphics equalizer and audio normalization available. But one feature that clearly stands out is <strong>VLC rotate video</strong> and save the video file.</p><p>You can rotate a video in VLC clockwise at 90, 180, and 270 degrees. The player also allows you to rotate videos at any arbitrary angle as per your requirement. In fact, you can flip the video horizontally and vertically as well as transpose the video as per your preference. Transposing a video means you are flipping and rotating at the same time.

It could be that the video has been taken at the wrong angle or you want to watch the video at a certain angle from a different perspective. The most common reason is that the video is taken in portrait mode and it looks small on your computer screen with black screen on both sides and you want to rotate the video to landscape mode. Here are the steps to perform VLC rotate video.</p><p>Step 1: Open VLC Media Player.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Media &gt; Open File option and select the video file that you want to rotate.</p><p>Step 3: Once the video opens, go to Tools &gt; Effects and Filters option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-tools-option.jpg"                      alt="vlc tools option"                ></p><p>Step 4: From Adjustments and Effects window, go to Video Effects tab.</p><p>Step 5: Under Video Effects tab, go to Geometry tab.</p><p>Step 6: Check Transform option and from the drop-down menu, select the required options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-adjustments-effects.jpg"                      alt="vlc adjustments and effects"                ></p><p>The options available are – rotate by 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, flip horizontally or vertically, transport and anti-transpose.</p><p>Step 7: If you want to rotate the video at any desired angle, you can check Rotate option and select the desired angle from the dial.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-video-effects.jpg"                      alt="vlc video effects"                ></p><p>Step 8: Finally, click on Save button and then on Close button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-rotated-video-vlc.jpg"                      alt="save rotated video vlc"                ></p><p>Now, you will get to see the video as per your selected angle instantly. But note that this VLC rotate effect will stay with VLC and if you open any other video file, it will also be displayed as per your selected angle. In order to disable this rotation effect, follow the same steps and this time, uncheck Transform and Rotate options.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Rotate-Video-in-VLC-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Rotate-Video-in-VLC-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Rotate Video in VLC on Mac"></a>Part 2. How to Rotate Video in VLC on Mac</h2><p>The process of VLC Media Player rotate video is slightly different on Mac as compared to Windows. Here are the steps to follow to rotate video on VLC temporarily.</p><p>Step 1: Open VLC Media Player. Go to File &gt; Open File option to open the video file that you want to rotate.</p><p>Step 2: Once you have opened the file, go to Window menu option.</p><p>Step 3: From the menu, select Video Effects option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-video-effects-mac.jpg"                      alt="vlc video effects mac"                ></p><p>Step 4: From Video Effects window, check Transform option.</p><p>Step 5: From the drop-down menu, select the option as per your requirement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-rotation-options.jpg"                      alt="vlc rotation"                ></p><p>The options available are - rotate by 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees. Besides, you can flip horizontally or vertically.</p><p>Step 6: Once done, just close Video Effects window and the changes will get saved automatically.</p><p>Just like Windows, this rotation will automatically apply to all the videos you open thereafter. Therefore, you have to repeat the steps and uncheck Transform option to undo the rotation effect.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-the-Rotation-Permanent"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-the-Rotation-Permanent" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to Make the Rotation Permanent"></a>Part 3. How to Make the Rotation Permanent</h2><p>The previous methods of VLC player rotate video on Windows and Mac will not save the video in that rotated angle as displayed. This means if you rotate a video in VLC using the method we have mentioned above, you will see the rotated video momentarily. But if you open the video in another media player or VLC without rotation settings turned off, the video will be playing at the original angle. If you want VLC rotate video and save feature so that the video’s rotation angle changes permanently, take the following steps on Windows.</p><p>Step 1: Open VLC player and open the video file.</p><p>Step 2: Follow all the steps we have mentioned on Method 1 - How to rotate video in VLC on Windows?</p><p>Step 3: Thereafter, go to Tool menu and select Preferences option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-preferences.jpg"                      alt="vlc preferences"                ></p><p>Step 4: Under Advanced Preferences option, go to Video &gt; Filters option from the left menu.</p><p>Step 5: Check Video transformation Filter option and click on Save button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-transformation-filters.jpg"                      alt="vlc transformtation filters"                ></p><p>Step 6: Go to Media menu and click on Convert Save option.</p><p>Step 7: Under Open Media Box, click on Add button and then click on Convert&#x2F;Save button.</p><p>Step 8: Under Convert Window, select Convert radio button and select a video output format. Then click on Settings icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/convert-vdeo-vlc.jpg"                      alt="convert video vlc"                ></p><p>Step 9: Under Profile Edition window, go to Video Codec tab. Select Video Transformation Filter option and click on Save button.</p><p>Step 10: You are back on Convert Window and finally, select a Destination File to save the new rotated video file and click on Start button.</p><p>Wait patiently for the process to get over and you can check the destination folder for the permanently rotated file.</p><p>Please note that this permanent rotation feature on VLC is only available for Windows users. Mac users are yet to get the feature and you can hope to see this permanent rotation feature in upcoming versions of VLC Media Player for MAC.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Alternative-Way-to-Rotate-Videos-Permanently"><a href="#Part-4-Alternative-Way-to-Rotate-Videos-Permanently" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

However, there are quite a few downsides to traditional PPT files, PowerPoint produces because the contents of your presentations can be easily modified and used by someone else.</p><p>The 2010 and later versions of PowerPoint have addressed this issue by including the Save to Video option that enabled users to create video files which can be easily posted on social media, video sharing platforms or used in eLearning courses. The built-in PPT file conversion option featured in recent versions of PowerPoint has certain limitations that prevent you from choosing the video file format or including inserted media files in the PowerPoint presentation video.</p><p>That’s the reason why we’ve gathered 10 best PPT to video converters that make the process of producing a video from a PowerPoint presentation easy and fun.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h2 id="Tips-for-Choosing-PPT-to-Video-Converter-Software"><a href="#Tips-for-Choosing-PPT-to-Video-Converter-Software" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Choosing PPT to Video Converter Software"></a>Tips for Choosing PPT to Video Converter Software</h2><p>Investing your money wisely is always a good idea because the most expensive solution is often not the best solution. The same is true for PPT to Video converter software, so before you go ahead and choose the program you will be using to convert your PowerPoint presentations into videos here are a few tips that will help you make up your mind.</p><p>Checking the amount of video file formats supported by the software is the key step towards selecting the right converter because it will give you the versatility the PowerPoint’s built-in PPT to video converter lacks. What’s more, some of the programs for PPT to video file conversions don’t allow you to convert audio files or animations into videos, which can ruin the original presentation, so prior to buying a software make sure that it can turn multimedia files into videos as well.</p><p>Last, but certainly not the least, try to determine whether or not the software is cost-effective because there is absolutely no point in spending a lot of money on a software that has the same PPT to video file conversion capabilities as PowerPoint.</p><h2 id="10-Best-PPT-to-Video-Converters"><a href="#10-Best-PPT-to-Video-Converters" class="headerlink" title="10 Best PPT to Video Converters"></a>10 Best PPT to Video Converters</h2><h4 id="1-Wondershare-PPT2Video-Pro"><a href="#1-Wondershare-PPT2Video-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1.

All methods have their own benefits and drawbacks. If you want our opinion on which method is the best among these three, we recommend you go with Filmora. It is because it is an all-in-one program.
