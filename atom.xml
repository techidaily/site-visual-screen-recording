Release Day "></a>Mjölnir Strikes Back! Release Day <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/god-of-war-ragnarok-poster1.jpg"                      alt="god-of-war-ragnarok-poster1"                ></h2><p>God of war Ragnarok, yes, that’s the name everywhere in the world of gameplays. In September 2021, PlayStation showcased a packed trailer with Daddy Kratos, foes along the Atreus. The trailer has been trending since the time it was released. Even the first look of the trailer is serving us with too much suspense. The addition of new characters, game details, and plot everything is so on point. Want to know more! Let’s jump to the further details.</p><h2 id="God-of-war-Ragnarok-Release-Date"><a href="#God-of-war-Ragnarok-Release-Date" class="headerlink" title="God of war Ragnarok: Release Date"></a><strong>God of war Ragnarok: Release Date</strong></h2><p>Desperate to know about the God of war Ragnarok Release Date! You reading this is clear proof that you are waiting for this fantastic addition to gameplay. PlayStation studios and Sony Santa announced that Release Date is now shifted from 2021 to 2022. Maybe it’s not a huge surprise for you, but the gameplay is worth waiting for</p><h2 id="God-of-war-Ragnarok-Story"><a href="#God-of-war-Ragnarok-Story" class="headerlink" title="God of war Ragnarok: Story"></a><strong>God of war Ragnarok: Story</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/god-of-war-ragnarok-poster2.jpg"                      alt="god-of-war-ragnarok-poster2"                ></p><p>Now when you are aware from the God of war Ragnarok Release Date, have a look to the storyline. After watching the trailer of God of war Ragnarok, our expectations are pretty high. The game is the ninth entry within the sequel of 2018’s jaw-dropping God of war. God of war was all about ancient Greece to Scandinavia, Kratos against the monsters, and Gods of Norse Mythology. The trailer gave us the idea to expect a more confident and older Atreus, and the next story is going to be based on his giant genes.</p><p>Now, the father and son are the new face of Ragnarok, the Norse version of disaster. Their new journey will be about facing the old enemies from God of War, Freya. New enemies include Thor and Kratos with his son’s rebellious nature. His son is the only one with knowledge about Atreus. The overall story will be based on a total of Nine Realms. Before this, God of War took place in six realms. The latest realms will be Asgard, Svartalfheim, and Vanaheim, along with the previous ones.</p><p>Furthermore, the trailer clarifies that we will see some new characters like Angrboa, who will be one of the last giants in the gameplay. Have you noticed a big guy in the trailer? He is Tyr, the son of Odin and half-brother of Baldur and Thor. But, the son is imprisoned by the father, isn’t it an incredible thrill? If you focus more on the PS5 showcase, you will realize it’s a brief and cryptic teaser. The overall trailer revolves more around the arrival of Ragnarok. In the excitement of “Ragnarok is coming,” most of us are not noticing the game footage. For us, it’s a confirmation of suspense. That background warning of Kratos is not less than an alarm for Atreus and viewers that we should “get ready.” At the end of God of War, we noticed that Kratos’s wife was another mystery; she was the Giant Laufey. This clearly shows that Atreus is Half God and as well as Half-Giant. He has a different name, i.e., Loki. Yes, Loki, the trickster of the Norse Mythology.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/god-of-war-ragnarok-poster3.jpg"                      alt="god-of-war-ragnarok-poster3"                ></p><p>Now, we expect that Ragnarok will explore Faye’s past and the reason she kept it secret. Hopefully, Atreus will get the shape-changing abilities that Loki is currently notorious for. So, Atreus is not just going to be about standing on the sidelines and firing arrows at enemies.</p><h2 id="God-of-War-Ragnarok-is-not-PS5-exclusive"><a href="#God-of-War-Ragnarok-is-not-PS5-exclusive" class="headerlink" title="God of War Ragnarok is not PS5 exclusive"></a><strong>God of War Ragnarok is not PS5 exclusive</strong></h2><p>Along with the God of war Ragnarok Release Date, there is news that the game will not be a PS5 exclusive.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Mastering-NVIDIA-Screenshot-Capture"><a href="#Mastering-NVIDIA-Screenshot-Capture" class="headerlink" title="Mastering NVIDIA Screenshot Capture"></a>Mastering NVIDIA Screenshot Capture</h2><p>When we talk about the best screen recorders for capturing gameplay, <strong>NVIDIA screen recorder</strong> prominently features on the list. NVIDIA is no more just a hardware company that is popular for designing gaming and graphics components. They have started launching software related to gaming and graphics that are gaining a lot of traction in the market. <strong>NVIDIA game recorder</strong> named NVIDIA ShadowPlay is quite popular as a professional screen recording application.</p><p>NVIDIA ShadowPlay is a feature-rich application that is designed to meet all the requirements of the users who want to record their screens and make a proper video out of the recordings. It can not only record gameplay on computers but also on gaming consoles such as PlayStation and Xbox. However, NVIDIA video recording does affect the performance of the games and graphics. In this article, we will have a complete look at the features and parameters of NVIDIA recorder and find out if there is a better alternative available.</p><p>Part 1. <a href="#part1">Key Features of NVIDIA Recorder</a></p><p>Part 2. <a href="#part2">How to Record Games NVIDIA Screen Recorder</a></p><p>Part 3. <a href="#part3">Performance and Requirements</a></p><p>Part 4. <a href="#part4">A Better Alternative for Screen Recording</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Key-Features-of-NVIDIA-Recorder"><a href="#Part-1-Key-Features-of-NVIDIA-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Key Features of NVIDIA Recorder"></a>Part 1. Key Features of NVIDIA Recorder</h2><p>NVIDIA record screen software is popular because it has all the different features that a user generally looks for while recording gameplay.</p><p><strong>Superior Recording Quality</strong> - NVIDIA ShadowPlay lets you record screen up to 8K HDR quality at 30 frames per second as well as 4K HDR quality at 60 frames per second. Therefore, you can get video recording at the pro-level for uploading on different platforms.</p><p><strong>Instant Reply Mode</strong> - When you turn on Instant Replay mode on ShadowPlay, the software keeps recording your gameplay in the background. If you have pulled off an amazing move in your game, you can press the hotkey to save the last 30 seconds of recorded gameplay on your computer. Therefore, you do not need to save the entire recorded video file. Instead, you can save only the important scenes and thereby save a lot of space on your drive.</p><p><strong>Key Gaming Moments</strong> - With the screen recorder NVIDIA Highlights feature, the software automatically captures the key moments in your gameplay and saves them for you to review. You can have all the important highlights from your gameplay and share them on social media platforms instantly.</p><p><strong>Live Streaming</strong> - You can live stream your gameplay on Twitch, YouTube, and Facebook at very high quality without any lag.

Besides, users can create stunning screenshots at 8k resolution and upload them to social media platforms without leaving the game.</p><p><strong>Useful Hotkeys</strong> - Gamers always prefer screen recorders that allow shortcut keys and hotkeys to avail different features. NVIDIA comes with a bundle of hotkeys for the convenience of the users and uninterrupted gameplay.</p><p><strong>User Interface</strong> - NVIDIA ShadowPlay has an intuitive and user-friendly interface that users can operate without going through any tutorial. There are not many complicated options and steps required and this enhances the overall user experience as well as the speed of operation.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Record-Games-NVIDIA-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Record-Games-NVIDIA-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Record Games NVIDIA Screen Recorder"></a>Part 2. How to Record Games NVIDIA Screen Recorder</h2><p>NVIDIA ShadowPlay comes under NVIDIA GeForce recording option. This means you cannot open ShadowPlay directly, and you have to open it via GeForce Experience. Therefore, you need to have GeForce Experience installed on your phone. Apart from ShadowPlay, you get a direct game streaming option, instant game settings optimization and NVIDIA graphics card updates under GeForce Experience. Here are the steps to follow to use NVIDIA record screen software to record gameplay.</p><p>Step 1: Download and install GeForce Experience from NVIDIA official website. Launch GeForce Experience from Windows Start menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shadowplay-overlay.jpg"                      alt="run nvidia shadowplay"                ></p><p>Step 2: Once GeForce Experience opens, you have to click on the Share button at the top-right corner. This will open NVIDIA Share toolbar at the top of the screen.</p><p>Step 3: Along with NVIDIA Share toolbar, you will see ShadowPlay overlay UI. There are mainly three options - Instant Replay, Record, and Broadcast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shadowplay-record.jpg"                      alt="shadowplay record button"                ></p><p>If you do not see the overlay containing recording options, click on the Share button at the left of the NVIDIA Share toolbar.</p><p>Step 4: Start the game whose gameplay you want to record. You will be asked to permit screen recording of the game.</p><p>Step 5: Turn on Instant Replay option to save epic moments during the gameplay. Finally, click on Record option and click on Start option to start recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/run-shadowplay-recorder.jpg"                      alt="run shadowplay recorder"                ></p><p>Step 6: During the gameplay, you can get back NVIDIA ShadowPlay overlay by pressing Alt + Z. Top stop recording, go to Record option and click on Stop and Save option.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Performance-and-Requirements"><a href="#Part-3-Performance-and-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Performance and Requirements"></a>Part 3. Performance and Requirements</h2><p>There have been concerns raised by professional gamers that when you use NVIDIA ShadowPlay to record gameplay or even broadcast gameplay live, it affects the performance of the game. After thorough experimentation, it has been found that running NVIDIA ShadowPlay to record gameplay or broadcast gameplay leads to the use of system resources. Therefore, there is a dip in the overall performance of the game of 5%-10%. Such a dip is negligible if you have a high-performance gaming computer.</p><p>However, the dip could be significant if your computer does not have a high configuration. In that case, the gameplay can get slightly slow and lag at times. In a fair comparison, NVIDIA GeForce recording may take slightly more system resources than most screen recording software. This means no matter which screen recorder you use, there will always be some dip in the performance of the game, and you should learn to neglect it.</p><p>NVIDIA record gameplay software is compatible with Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10. It is not compatible with Linux or macOS. Here is the list of system requirements for NVIDIA ShadowPlay.</p><ul><li>RAM - 4GB or Higher.</li><li>CPU - Intel Pentium G series, Intel Core i3 or higher.</li><li>AMD FX, Ryzen 3 and higher.</li><li>GPU - GeForce GTX 650 or Higher.</li><li>Driver - GeForce 430.64 or later.</li><li>Price - Free.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-A-Better-Alternative-for-Screen-Recording"><a href="#Part-4-A-Better-Alternative-for-Screen-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. A Better Alternative for Screen Recording"></a>Part 4. A Better Alternative for Screen Recording</h2><p>There are several concerns regarding NVIDIA screen recorder starting from performance issue to recording not working suddenly issue. Therefore, users who use NVIDIA screen recorder, they always look for a better alternative. Filmora - <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Screen Video Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a great alternative, and it scores over ShadowPlay on all parameters. This is because Filmora is not only a feature-rich screen recorder but also a great video editor.</p><p>Instead of recording the entire screen all the time, you can record only a specific part of the screen with Filmora. Similarly, you can give a voiceover to your reordered video, add special effects and filters as well as transitions for the video to look completely professional and stunning.

Chances are that you don’t have the Media Center’s icon on your desktop, so the fastest way to launch this software is to click on the Start menu, then go to All Programs and select the Windows Media Center from the list.</p><h4 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 "></a>Step 2 <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows7-record-tv.jpg"                      alt="windows 7 recording tv"                ></h4><p>After you’ve successfully launched the software, scroll through its main menu and select the TV option. You should then click on the Guide feature, but before you can watch TV or record TV shows from your computer, you must first make sure that your TV Tuner Card is properly connected to your satellite or cable TV device, as well as your PC. Furthermore, if you are using the Windows Media Center for the first time, you’ll also have to go through the software’s Live TV setup procedure.</p><h4 id="Step-3"><a href="#Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h4><p>Click on the Guide feature, and browse through the TV program in order to select the TV show you’d like to record.

If you want to start recording right away, you should simply click on the Record button, while the Record Series button will enable you to record every episode of a selected TV series to your PC’s hard-drive. In order to prevent a recording session, simply click on the Do Not Record button in the show’s info page.</p><h2 id="How-to-record-live-TV-on-Windows-10-for-free"><a href="#How-to-record-live-TV-on-Windows-10-for-free" class="headerlink" title="How to record live TV on Windows 10 for free"></a>How to record live TV on Windows 10 for free</h2><p>Although using the Windows Media Center on Windows 10 is possible, it is not recommended since it can produce needless complications. However, the Xbox Game DVR that enables its users to capture video games or record live TV is one of the best video recording software Windows 10 has to offer.</p><h4 id="Step-1-1"><a href="#Step-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h4><p>Although you may not know it, the version of the Windows 10 you have installed on your PC features the Xbox Game DVR application. If you are not sure where exactly on your hard-disk this software is located, you can just go to the Start menu and type in Xbox in the search bar. Click on the Xbox Game DVR icon and proceed to set up your Xbox account if you already don’t have one.</p><h4 id="Step-2-1"><a href="#Step-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h4><p>After you’ve launched the program, find the Game DVR icon that is located in the ribbon on the left side of your screen. You must set up the Game DVR, before using it, but luckily you’ll only have to go through this process once. After you’ve completed the setup, you should launch the software you’re using to watch TV on your computer.</p><h4 id="Step-3-1"><a href="#Step-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h4><p>Hold the Windows and G keys to launch the game bar, and after you’ve selected the TV show feel free to start your new TV recording session.</p><h2 id="Free-TV-Show-Recording-Software-on-Windows"><a href="#Free-TV-Show-Recording-Software-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Free TV Show Recording Software on Windows"></a>Free TV Show Recording Software on Windows</h2><p>Trying to record live TV with built-in software on Windows can limit your options, which is why using free TV recording software is a much better idea if you’d like to have complete control over the live TV recording process.</p><h4 id="1-MediaPortal"><a href="#1-MediaPortal" class="headerlink" title="1. MediaPortal"></a>1. MediaPortal</h4><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Provides fast and simple ways to record live TV.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Its interface could be designed better.</p><p>This open source application ranks highly among the best TV recording software currently available on the market. It is remarkably easy to use and it also enables its users to start recording sessions with keyboard shortcuts. MediaPortal is a perfect tool that will allow you to record TV shows effortlessly and even schedule live TV recording sessions. The software’s guide is more like a personal assistant that notifies you if there is an upcoming recording session, enables you to define channel groups or to gain more information about a movie or a TV show from IMDB.</p><p>In order to start recording you just have to press the R key, while watching TV on your computer, or alternatively, you can hold the F9 key to access the info menu that also features a Record button.</p><h4 id="2-NextPVR"><a href="#2-NextPVR" class="headerlink" title="2. NextPVR"></a>2. NextPVR</h4><p><strong>Pros:</strong> A wide spectrum of recording options.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Using NextPVR for commercial purposes require a license.</p><p>Even though the installation process of the NextPVR may be a little complicated, the benefits it provides outweigh the trouble users must go through in order to install it properly. This software can also be used as an add-on for the Kodi home theater software. You can use the Kody to play live TV on your PC, while NextPVR records your favorite sporting events, movies, and TV shows.</p><p>However, NextPVR also works as a standalone program, and in order to start recording live TV you can just click on the Man-Rec button and adjust all the settings manually. The Recording Type feature will help you select the kind of recording that best meets your current demands, while the Channel option allows you to choose the channel you’d like to record.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unrestricted-display-save-tool/"><u>2024 Approved  Unrestricted Display Save Tool</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-visionary-software-solutions-for-virtual-meetings/"><u>2024 Approved  Visionary Software Solutions for Virtual Meetings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-recording-made-simple-a-compreenasite-for-capturing-netflix-content-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Recording Made Simple  A Compreenasite for Capturing Netflix Content for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-guide-to-iphoneipad-recording/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Guide to iPhone/iPad Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-essential-manual-to-operating-streamlabs-obs/"><u>In 2024, The Essential Manual to Operating Streamlabs OBS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-the-broadcasters-blueprint-step-by-step-windows-pc-guide-to-live-capture/"><u>[New] The Broadcaster's Blueprint  Step-by-Step Windows PC Guide to Live Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-essential-methods-to-record-your-fb-live-events/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Essential Methods to Record Your FB Live Events</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-perfecting-your-rl-game-captures/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Perfecting Your RL Game Captures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-bandicam-screen-recorder-review-for-2024/"><u>[New] Bandicam Screen Recorder Review for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/the-new-age-of-income-generation-for-youtube-visionaries/"><u>The New Age of Income Generation for YouTube Visionaries</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/tips-and-tricks-for-setting-up-your-nokia-c02-phone-pattern-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>Tips and Tricks for Setting Up your Nokia C02 Phone Pattern Lock</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/updated-audiophiles-guide-to-selecting-premium-podcast-mics/"><u>[Updated] Audiophile's Guide to Selecting Premium Podcast Mics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-youtube-and-dailymotion-unveiling-core-variations/"><u>[Updated] YouTube & Dailymotion  Unveiling Core Variations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-from-live-demos-to-replays-tapping-into-aiseesoft-screencast-potential-for-2024/"><u>[New] From Live Demos to Replays  Tapping Into Aiseesoft Screencast Potential for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-detect-and-remove-spyware-on-google-pixel-fold-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Detect and Remove Spyware on Google Pixel Fold? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-the-foodies-framebook-stepwise-filming/"><u>[New] The Foodie's Framebook  Stepwise Filming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-gopro-hero5-experience-recap/"><u>[New] In 2024, GoPro Hero5 Experience Recap</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/a-comprehensive-look-at-youtubes-adsense-mechanisms-for-2024/"><u>A Comprehensive Look at YouTube's AdSense Mechanisms for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/elite-videotelephony-for-effective-online-meetings-for-2024/"><u>Elite Videotelephony for Effective Online Meetings for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

In the past, <strong>recording internal audio</strong> in Android is severely restricted by Google. However, KitKat version of Android OS has finally enabled Android Smartphone users to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record the screens <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on their devices, but recording the clear and perfect internal audio is not an easy job because of the Android OS policy that screen recording apps are not given the permission to record the internal sound of the Android phone or tablet after Android Lollipop version, recording the internal sound through microphone is a solution. Still, it picks up background noise while screen capturing is in progress.</p><p>So, how to create an internal audio recording on your Android devices?

This method of recording audio had many downsides, including poor audio quality and capturing of distracting background noises.</p><p>There are several different ways in which you can record system audio and avoid producing screen recordings with terrible sound. Each of the methods includes using third-party apps or screen capturing devices, since Android Lollipop and later versions of the Android OS, still don’t offer an effective solution to this problem.</p><h3 id="1-Use-Mobizen-Screen-Recorder-with-Internal-Audio-App-to-Record-the-internal-audio-on-Android"><a href="#1-Use-Mobizen-Screen-Recorder-with-Internal-Audio-App-to-Record-the-internal-audio-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Mobizen Screen Recorder with Internal Audio App to Record the internal audio on Android"></a>1. Use Mobizen Screen Recorder with Internal Audio App to Record the internal audio on Android</h3><p>Recently, RSUPPORT company developed the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rsupport.mvagent" >Mobizen Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app that is equipped with all the essential screen recording tools. At the same time, it also allows its users to record only sound produced by their Smartphones during the screen recording session. You can download this app for free on the Google Play store, but if you choose to install it on your Android phone, you should arm yourself with patience since this app contains ads.</p><p>After you’ve successfully installed Mobizen Screen Recorder on your Android Smartphone, you should launch the app and look for the Settings gear icon located in the upper right corner of your screen. Tap on the Sound option, and before proceeding any further, you should make sure that Sound is enabled. Once you allow the Sound feature, you’ll be able to see the Options menu that offers External and Internal features. By selecting the Internal option, you will instruct the app to record only the sound produced by the gameplay of the video game you are recording or a YouTube video you’re playing while the screen recording session is in progress.</p><p>The result you will get is the crystal clear audio in your screen recording, but Mobizen app performs well <strong>only with Samsung and LG Android phones</strong>, so if you have an Android device from some other manufacturer, this app may underperform.</p><h3 id="2-Record-the-internal-audio-from-a-microphone-on-Android-with-the-AZ-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#2-Record-the-internal-audio-from-a-microphone-on-Android-with-the-AZ-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="2. Record the internal audio from a microphone on Android with the AZ Screen Recorder"></a>2. Record the internal audio from a microphone on Android with the AZ Screen Recorder</h3><p>If you choose to utilize this method of recording internal audio, make sure that the room where your recording is completely silent since the microphone you will be using can pick up external sounds as well as internal audio.</p><p>You can download the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en" >AZ Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from the Google Play for free. Once the installation is complete, launch the app and tap on the Settings icon. This app won’t record sound until you enable this option, which is the reason why you should locate the Record Audio feature in the Settings menu.</p><p>At this point, you should exit the app, and click on the AZ bubble on the side of your Smartphone’s screen. Tap on the Record icon to start the screen recording session and proceed to perform all actions you wanted to capture with your Android device. The audio will be recorded simultaneously with the video. When ready, slide down the notification bar, and stop the screen recording session.</p><p>In order to extract the audio file, you’ll have to transfer the screen recording you made with AZ Screen Recorder to a PC and perform this action with a video editing software. You may have to create several screen recordings of your Smartphone’s screen before you get the perfect audio because the device’s microphone is going to capture all sound it can pick up, both external and internal.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Record-Android-internal-audio-with-a-capture-card"><a href="#Part-2-Record-Android-internal-audio-with-a-capture-card" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Record Android internal audio with a capture card"></a>Part 2: Record Android internal audio with a capture card</h2><p>Capture cards are much more than screen recorders since they mostly serve as a bridge between a PC and the device whose screen you are trying to capture. Professionals often use capture cards, despite their prices, simply because they enable them to record high-quality screen recordings, create live streams, and record internal audio from any device they are connected to, including Android Smartphones.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-capture-card.jpg"                      alt="Record Android games on PC with capture card"                ></p><p>Most capture cards are equipped with their own screen recording software, so the process of adjusting the video and audio settings depends on the capture card you have.

The entire world of Minecraft is based on squares and cubes. Minecraft allows you to create amazing buildings, homes, and a kingdom. To make your buildings unique and different you can add different elements and shapes in your buildings such as circles, spheres, and curves. Circle and spheres are used as decorating materials and can be very helpful in creating different things and buildings. It seems impossible to build circles and spheres using cubes. You can create a circle and sphere easily by following simple steps. If you ever look at an image of a circle after zooming in, you will notice small pixels in the form of squares that are held together to create a circle. We can use such a technique to create a circle and sphere using cubic blocks in Minecraft. We can create pixelated circles and spheres without any curves. In this article, we will illustrate how to make a circle in Minecraft and how to make a sphere in Minecraft separately.</p><hr><h2 id="How-to-make-a-circle-in-Minecraft-A-Step-by-Step-Guide"><a href="#How-to-make-a-circle-in-Minecraft-A-Step-by-Step-Guide" class="headerlink" title="How to make a circle in Minecraft: A Step by Step Guide"></a>How to make a circle in Minecraft: A Step by Step Guide</h2><p>If you have ever noticed that when we zoom in out images, small pixels are held together to form a perfect image. We have to apply the same method here. We have to take these cubes as pixels and connect them with each other for a complete picture to form a circle.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step of how to make a circle in Minecraft is to decide the circumference of the circle you want to create. In this example, we are going to create a circle with a circumference of 17 blocks. You can choose any circumference depending upon the size of the circle you want. Place 17 blocks in a series to make a straight line. Now at the 9th block, which is the middle of the line, place two blocks perpendicular blocks on both sides of the line.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle1.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now add 7 blocks on each side of the line to make a plus ‘+’ sign. It will create a circumference of the circle by both the x-axis and y-axis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle2.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> At the edges of each line create a perpendicular line of 5 blocks each. This will create an outer boundary of the circle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle3.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now to complete the outer boundary of the circle, you have to add two blocks in the same direction of the outer line of the circle. But this time come a little bit closer to the center of the circle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle4.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle4"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Complete the outer by adding an ‘L’ shaped structure created with 3 blocks on each of the four sides of the circle to complete the outer boundary.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle5.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle5"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Since the outer of the circle is complete, now you can either remove the center lines of the circle to make it hollow or fill it with the blocks to make it a complete filled circle and make it a place where you can stand.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle6.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle6"                ></p><hr><h2 id="How-to-make-a-Sphere-in-Minecraft"><a href="#How-to-make-a-Sphere-in-Minecraft" class="headerlink" title="How to make a Sphere in Minecraft"></a>How to make a Sphere in Minecraft</h2><p>The only difference between making a circle and a sphere is the difference in dimensions. The circle is Two Dimensional and the sphere is three-dimensional. It is not as difficult as it seems.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To get started, create a tall column of the block according to the size of the sphere that you want to make. In this example, we are going to form a 16 blocks long column. You can change it according to your requirement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere1.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now it’s time to create layers of the sphere. To do that you have to create a layer of 7 blocks wide on the top and the bottom of the column.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere2.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Since you have created the 1st and the 16th levels of the sphere, now you have to follow this procedure for all remaining layers: Make a layer of 11 blocks for the 2nd and 15th levels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere3.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Follow the same pattern throughout the levels: 13 blocks layer on 3rd and 14th level, 15 blocks on 4th and 13th levels, 17 blocks on 5th and 12th level, and so on. As you can notice that each new level comes with 2 extra blocks. Follow this process until you reach the middle of the column.</p><p>These circles and spheres are useful in Minecraft and they play a very vital role in building your own world in Minecraft. They can be very beneficial while creating buildings, houses, and more places. These can be used as curves to give your buildings an aesthetic look and feel. But this whole process needs practice and efforts to master it and use it for your own purposes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere4.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere4"                ></p><hr><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Creating such amazing things and sharing them on your social media and video sharing platforms can get you a lot of audience and views.

Chill, you don’t need a professional studio for this purpose. There is a lot of software, but zoom podcast recording is relatively more straightforward. A podcast is a collection of audio files that you can either download or listen to online using the internet. This article will help you learn to record podcasts using zoom.</p><h2 id="7-Step-Formula-How-To-Record-a-Podcast-on-Zoom"><a href="#7-Step-Formula-How-To-Record-a-Podcast-on-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="7-Step Formula: How To Record a Podcast on Zoom?"></a>7-Step Formula: How To Record a Podcast on Zoom?</h2><p>Recording a podcast on zoom is quite simple and easy. You don’t need to be a recording expert; you can get it done at home using your laptop. In this article, I will guide you on how to record a podcast using zoom step by step.</p><h5 id="Step1-Download-and-Install"><a href="#Step1-Download-and-Install" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Download and Install"></a>Step1 Download and Install</h5><p>The 1st step is downloading and installing zoom on your device. Next, create your zoom account by visiting the <a class="link"   href="https://soft-portal.shop/zoom/?url=https://zoom.us&id=5&geo=&ub=https://soft-portal.shop/zoom/&gclid=Cj0KCQjw48OaBhDWARIsAMd966AtsDXlasyuqO9r1vrbTzSdxKyOMLNsfNLa_RFZ12PRcu09P4sKnMcaAlUHEALw_wcB" >zoom website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

For longer calls, purchase the paid version.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-1.jpg"                      alt="download and install zoom"                ></p><h5 id="Step2-Setting-Up-Microphone-and-Headphones"><a href="#Step2-Setting-Up-Microphone-and-Headphones" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Setting Up Microphone and Headphones"></a>Step2 Setting Up Microphone and Headphones</h5><p>Zoom can use your device’s built-in microphone, but it is advised to use a high-quality external mic. It enhances the quality of your podcast tremendously. Plenty of external mics are available for under 50$, which can make a real difference.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-2.jpg"                      alt="set up microphone and headphones"                ></p><h5 id="Step3-Eliminate-Any-Background-Noise"><a href="#Step3-Eliminate-Any-Background-Noise" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Eliminate Any Background Noise"></a>Step3 Eliminate Any Background Noise</h5><p>No one is interested in listening to what’s happening in the background while listening to your podcast. So, before pressing the ‘Record’ button, ensure your environment is as quiet as possible. You can take the following steps to reduce background noises.</p><ul><li>Turn off the fan, air conditioner, or any other noisy appliances.</li><li>Remove noisy kids, roommates, or pets.</li><li>Hang a ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign on your front door.</li><li>Shut your door and windows to avoid noise from outside sources, such as sirens, traffic horns, etc.</li><li>Avoid the rustling sound of paper or moving things around your desk.</li><li>Install noise-canceling software to filter out any background noise.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-3.jpg"                      alt="eliminate background noise"                ></p><h5 id="Step4-Set-Up-Separate-Audio-Tracks-for-Each-Speaker"><a href="#Step4-Set-Up-Separate-Audio-Tracks-for-Each-Speaker" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Set Up Separate Audio Tracks for Each Speaker"></a>Step4 Set Up Separate Audio Tracks for Each Speaker</h5><p>Wouldn’t it be easier to edit your podcast if you recorded audio tracks for each speaker separately? Zoom has this feature of recording separate audio tracks.</p><p>To enable this, go to your zoom ‘Settings’ and click on the ‘Recording’ setting. Then select “Record a separate audio file for each participant,” and you are ready to go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-4.jpg"                      alt="separate audio tracks for each speaker"                ></p><h5 id="Step5-Brief-Your-Guest-About-Zoom-Functioning-Before-You-Begin"><a href="#Step5-Brief-Your-Guest-About-Zoom-Functioning-Before-You-Begin" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Brief Your Guest About Zoom Functioning Before You Begin"></a>Step5 Brief Your Guest About Zoom Functioning Before You Begin</h5><p>If you are going live and your guest is new to zoom, it is better that you guide him briefly about the functioning of zoom. Guide your guest on how to join the call using zoom. It would be best if you also told him about the duration and topic of your podcast.</p><p>It is advised to test the microphone and headphones of your guest before starting a live podcast. Your guest does not need to download and install zoom on their device; he can join by clicking the link and entering the call from his browser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-5.jpg"                      alt="brief the guest about zoom functioning"                ></p><h5 id="Step6-Record-the-Call-Using-Zoom"><a href="#Step6-Record-the-Call-Using-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Record the Call Using Zoom"></a>Step6 Record the Call Using Zoom</h5><p>It is pretty simple to record a podcast using zoom.

Of course, every software has its limits, and so does zoom, and these limitations are discussed below.</p><h3 id="●-Audio-and-Video-Quality"><a href="#●-Audio-and-Video-Quality" class="headerlink" title="● Audio and Video Quality"></a>● Audio and Video Quality</h3><p> Zoom’s priority is virtual conferencing, which compromises audio and video quality to optimize the speed and smoothness of calling. Besides, the recording audio and video quality depend upon your internet speed. If your internet is slow, you will experience lag and interruptions in your recorded podcasts.</p><h3 id="●-Compressed-Audio-and-Video"><a href="#●-Compressed-Audio-and-Video" class="headerlink" title="● Compressed Audio and Video"></a>● Compressed Audio and Video</h3><p>Zoom compresses your audio and video files by removing portions of audio tracks making the file smaller. Audio compression makes your video chat smooth, but the resulting recorded file is of low quality for professional use.</p><h3 id="●-Time-limit"><a href="#●-Time-limit" class="headerlink" title="● Time limit"></a>● Time limit</h3><p>With the free plan, you can make calls for a maximum of 40 minutes. To record longer podcasts, you must spend money on the paid version.</p><h2 id="Tips-to-Elevate-Your-Podcast-With-Zoom"><a href="#Tips-to-Elevate-Your-Podcast-With-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Tips to Elevate Your Podcast With Zoom"></a>Tips to Elevate Your Podcast With Zoom</h2><ul><li>Ensure you and your guest have a strong and stable internet connection.</li><li>Give your guest a brief tutorial on zoom before going live.</li><li>Use a high-quality podcast microphone for better audio quality.</li><li>Make sure your environment is quiet, and there is no background noise.</li><li>Use your device’s built-in video recorder to record a backup podcast.

In September 2021, PlayStation showcased a packed trailer with Daddy Kratos, foes along the Atreus. The trailer has been trending since the time it was released. Even the first look of the trailer is serving us with too much suspense. The addition of new characters, game details, and plot everything is so on point. Want to know more! Let’s jump to the further details.</p><h2 id="God-of-war-Ragnarok-Release-Date"><a href="#God-of-war-Ragnarok-Release-Date" class="headerlink" title="God of war Ragnarok: Release Date"></a><strong>God of war Ragnarok: Release Date</strong></h2><p>Desperate to know about the God of war Ragnarok Release Date! You reading this is clear proof that you are waiting for this fantastic addition to gameplay. PlayStation studios and Sony Santa announced that Release Date is now shifted from 2021 to 2022. Maybe it’s not a huge surprise for you, but the gameplay is worth waiting for</p><h2 id="God-of-war-Ragnarok-Story"><a href="#God-of-war-Ragnarok-Story" class="headerlink" title="God of war Ragnarok: Story"></a><strong>God of war Ragnarok: Story</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/god-of-war-ragnarok-poster2.jpg"                      alt="god-of-war-ragnarok-poster2"                ></p><p>Now when you are aware from the God of war Ragnarok Release Date, have a look to the storyline. After watching the trailer of God of war Ragnarok, our expectations are pretty high. The game is the ninth entry within the sequel of 2018’s jaw-dropping God of war. God of war was all about ancient Greece to Scandinavia, Kratos against the monsters, and Gods of Norse Mythology. The trailer gave us the idea to expect a more confident and older Atreus, and the next story is going to be based on his giant genes.</p><p>Now, the father and son are the new face of Ragnarok, the Norse version of disaster. Their new journey will be about facing the old enemies from God of War, Freya. New enemies include Thor and Kratos with his son’s rebellious nature. His son is the only one with knowledge about Atreus. The overall story will be based on a total of Nine Realms. Before this, God of War took place in six realms. The latest realms will be Asgard, Svartalfheim, and Vanaheim, along with the previous ones.</p><p>Furthermore, the trailer clarifies that we will see some new characters like Angrboa, who will be one of the last giants in the gameplay. Have you noticed a big guy in the trailer? He is Tyr, the son of Odin and half-brother of Baldur and Thor. But, the son is imprisoned by the father, isn’t it an incredible thrill? If you focus more on the PS5 showcase, you will realize it’s a brief and cryptic teaser. The overall trailer revolves more around the arrival of Ragnarok. In the excitement of “Ragnarok is coming,” most of us are not noticing the game footage. For us, it’s a confirmation of suspense. That background warning of Kratos is not less than an alarm for Atreus and viewers that we should “get ready.” At the end of God of War, we noticed that Kratos’s wife was another mystery; she was the Giant Laufey. This clearly shows that Atreus is Half God and as well as Half-Giant. He has a different name, i.e., Loki. Yes, Loki, the trickster of the Norse Mythology.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/god-of-war-ragnarok-poster3.jpg"                      alt="god-of-war-ragnarok-poster3"                ></p><p>Now, we expect that Ragnarok will explore Faye’s past and the reason she kept it secret. Hopefully, Atreus will get the shape-changing abilities that Loki is currently notorious for. So, Atreus is not just going to be about standing on the sidelines and firing arrows at enemies.</p><h2 id="God-of-War-Ragnarok-is-not-PS5-exclusive"><a href="#God-of-War-Ragnarok-is-not-PS5-exclusive" class="headerlink" title="God of War Ragnarok is not PS5 exclusive"></a><strong>God of War Ragnarok is not PS5 exclusive</strong></h2><p>Along with the God of war Ragnarok Release Date, there is news that the game will not be a PS5 exclusive.

For instance, you can send a message to everyone in the chat or send a private message to one of the participants, mention participant(s) while typing a message, and can even send a file to them if need be. You can learn how to do all these by following their corresponding methods given below:</p><h3 id="1-How-to-Mention-People-in-Zoom-Chat"><a href="#1-How-to-Mention-People-in-Zoom-Chat" class="headerlink" title="1. How to Mention People in Zoom Chat?"></a>1. How to Mention People in Zoom Chat?</h3><p>As it is with most social media platforms these days, even in Zoom chat, you can use the @ sign followed by the starting few characters of the person you want to mention. When you start typing, a list of participants with the matching names would appear, and you can then choose the one you want to mention.</p><h3 id="2-How-to-Send-Chat-Announcements"><a href="#2-How-to-Send-Chat-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="2.

While the first two steps explain how to enable the <strong>Announcements</strong> feature and add the users who can send or receive announcements, the third step teaches how to send announcements to all the users you added.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Enable-Announcements"><a href="#Step-1-Enable-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enable Announcements"></a>Step 1: Enable Announcements</h4><p>Launch your favorite browser, sign in to the web portal of your Zoom account, go to <strong>Account Management</strong> &gt; <strong>IM Management</strong> &gt; <strong>IM Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Visibility</strong> and then turn on the <strong>Announcements</strong> switch.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Add-Users-for-Announcements"><a href="#Step-2-Add-Users-for-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Add Users for Announcements"></a>Step 2: Add Users for Announcements</h4><p>Click the <strong>+</strong> icon, in the available field type the email address(es) of the user(s) you want to allow to send or receive the announcements and click <strong>Add</strong> to add the participant(s) once found. Next, you can now safely sign out of the web portal of your Zoom account, and proceed to the next step.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Send-Announcements"><a href="#Step-3-Send-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Send Announcements "></a>Step 3: Send Announcements <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-announcement.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat  Announcements"                ></h4><p>Launch Zoom app and sign into your account. Click the <strong>Chat</strong> icon from the top, click <strong>Announcements</strong> from the left bar, type a message in the text box in the right and&#x2F;or attach a file if need be.

What File Types Does Zoom Chat Support?</h3><p><strong>Note:</strong> Restricting file types and configuring other options granularly can only be done if you have purchased a paid subscription plan.</p><p>At the time of this writing, <strong>Zoom chat</strong> supports almost all types of files. However, by signing in to your account on Zoom’s web portal, you can restrict them by their extensions. For example, you can configure your Zoom account to send only the files with JPG, ZIP, or RAR extensions.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Save-Zoom-Chats"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Save-Zoom-Chats" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Save Zoom Chats"></a>Part 3: How to Save Zoom Chats</h2><p>Zoom also allows you to save your text conversions for future references.

Can Zoom host see private chats?"></a><strong>Q) Is Zoom chat secure, safe, and encrypted? Can Zoom host see private chats?</strong></h4><p><strong>A) Yes and No.</strong></p><p>To answer the first question, Zoom chats are encrypted. However, the encryption is disabled by default and must be enabled by turning on the <strong>Require Encryption for 3rd Party Endpoints (H323&#x2F;SIP)</strong> switch from the <strong>In Meeting (Basic)</strong> section.</p><p>Tips</p><p>As a video call host, if you don’t want the participant to save the chat content, you should enable <strong>Prevent participants from saving chat</strong> and save the changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-prevent-participants-from-saving-chat.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat  Saving Settings"                ></p><p>Furthermore, if you have a paid subscription of Zoom, you can use advanced encryption method that is available on the <strong>IM Management</strong> page on your account’s web portal. About the second question, the host cannot see the private messages that the participants send to each other during a meeting session.</p><h4 id="Q-Can-people-see-my-chat-when-I-am-screen-sharing"><a href="#Q-Can-people-see-my-chat-when-I-am-screen-sharing" class="headerlink" title="Q) Can people see my chat when I am screen sharing?"></a><strong>Q) Can people see my chat when I am screen sharing?</strong></h4><p>A) No.</p><p>As long as you are chatting using <strong>Zoom chat</strong>, other participants cannot see your conversation. However, if there is something else on your screen such as your Facebook profile&#x2F;chat, your email account, or your bank account’s page, all those windows can be viewed by the participants you are sharing your screen with.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong>Zoom chat</strong> is an easy way to converse with the participants in case there are some typical words that need to be spelled or some files to be shared. These chats are not only encrypted, they can also be controlled by the host so that the participants can send messages only to the host, to each other, or to no one at all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-communicating-confidently-on-google-meet/"><u>[New] Communicating Confidently on Google Meet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-optimal-6-crafted-urban-home-concepts/"><u>In 2024, Optimal 6 Crafted Urban Home Concepts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-expert-screenshot-software-win/"><u>[New] Expert Screenshot Software (Win)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-capturing-every-aspect-of-minecraft-play-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Capturing Every Aspect of Minecraft Play for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-essential-visual-captures-on-apple-systems-limit-156-characters/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Essential Visual Captures on Apple Systems (Limit  156 Characters)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-finest-12-tycoons-your-pathway-to-gaming-enthusiasm/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  The Finest 12 Tycoons  Your Pathway to Gaming Enthusiasm</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-ultimate-list-of-kung-fu-video-games/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Ultimate List of Kung Fu Video Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-fixing-dropped-frames-a-complete-guide-for-obs-studio-users/"><u>[New] In 2024, Fixing Dropped Frames  A Complete Guide for OBS Studio Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-process-of-recording-in-adobe-presenter-for-2024/"><u>Unveiling the Process of Recording in Adobe Presenter for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/best-9-virtual-mic-recorders-to-enhance-remote-sessions-23-for-2024/"><u>Best 9 Virtual Mic Recorders to Enhance Remote Sessions ('23) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/how-to-make-a-diy-vlog-or-video/"><u>How to Make a DIY Vlog or Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-full-spectrum-analysis-the-complete-logitech-4k-webcam-review/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Full Spectrum Analysis  The Complete Logitech 4K Webcam Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-androidprocessmedia-has-stopped-on-gionee-f3-pro-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Fix Android.Process.Media Has Stopped on Gionee F3 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-data-from-lost-or-stolen-iphone-15-pro-in-easy-steps-stellar-by-stellar-data-recovery-ios-iphone-data-recovery/"><u>How To Recover Data From Lost or Stolen iPhone 15 Pro In Easy Steps | Stellar</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-6-proven-techniques-to-elevate-your-youtube-engagement-and-reduce-churn/"><u>[New] In 2024, 6 Proven Techniques to Elevate Your YouTube Engagement and Reduce Churn</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-proficiently-follow-facebook-live-updates-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How to Proficiently Follow Facebook Live Updates for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-guide-to-hand-drawing-whiteboard-animation-software/"><u>New The Ultimate Guide to Hand Drawing Whiteboard Animation Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-monetize-like-a-pro-how-to-use-youtube-studio-on-any-device/"><u>[New] Monetize Like a Pro  How to Use Youtube Studio on Any Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-make-censor-effects-with-filmora/"><u>Updated How to Make Censor Effects with Filmora</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-funimate-playbook-strategies-for-success/"><u>In 2024, Funimate Playbook  Strategies for Success</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>
